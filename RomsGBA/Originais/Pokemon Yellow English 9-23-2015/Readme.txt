#1. About Pokemon Yellow  #
###########################

This game was originally created by Shenzhen Nanjing Technology

This game is very much like the Gameboy version with some differences.  

All 151 Pokemon are available to catch, along with legendaries from Gen 2 and 3 for a total of 159 Pokemon
The graphics are superior to the Gameboy version
Plus, there's post game content that will let you obtain legendary Pokemon

#2. About This Hack#
####################

This is a translation and improvements of Shenzhen Nanjing's game.

Along with the translation, there's been some other improvements:

Color palletes have been changed to fix the appearance of the pokemon and menus
All music has been replaced with music from Gen 1 and 2
And EXP growth has been fixed to make leveling up much less tedious.


Thank you Chpexo for making the title screen, it really looks great!

#3. Known Issues#
#################

There's untranslated sections of the game, if you come across any, please contact me on Romhacking.net

There may be occasions where text runs over graphics on the ppu, you just need to leave whatever screen you're on and go back to it.

It's pretty simple, just use Lunar IPS and apply this patch to the untranslated Chinese ROM.
