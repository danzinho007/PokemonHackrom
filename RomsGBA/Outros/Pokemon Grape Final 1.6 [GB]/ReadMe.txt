			And So the Adventure Begins!
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Welcome to the Pokemon World!
Pokemon, or Pocket Monsters, are strange and marvelous creatures.
Some people treat them as pets, many others instead adopt them as their battling monsters and engage
them in what are called Pokemon fights.
   There are still many mysteries around Pokemon to solve, and there are a lot of adventures and tales
based on them. While the canonical stories are the most known, common people eventually came up with
their own folklore and legends. Pokemon Grape is one of such adventures, and it's one of those
spurious anecdotes that circulates among the fancy of the folks.
This weird story is set up in a completely new Region: legend claims that this amusing series
of events took place a year after the events of Pokemon Red and Blue (and of Ruby & Sapphire, perhaps).
                        ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~

   Welcome to the Region of Frejo! It's 1999, and you will impersonate a former baseball player.
Our hero is not an aspiring Pokemon Trainer: he is an affirmed baseball player.
However, due to the circumstances, he has to get involved in this adventure.
   After a small interview by Professor Bek (formerly, Professor Tek, but misspelled "Bek" due to a
mistake by the Anagraph Office), you will find yourself in your home, in Paceleaf City.
On the table you can read the Instruction Book for a few useful tips on your adventure.
You may also check out the Town Map on the wall to see the Region you live on, the Region of Frejo.
   Before leaving home, check out your Personal Computer: the protagonist stores a few Fresh Water
bottles, and you will certainly need those: without adequate preparation, and without exploration,
this game may turn out pretty hard. However, once you discover a few secrets and make a
few right guessings, this game may even turn into a piece of cake.
Remember: the scenario and the layout are not random, and many items, people, or pokemon at your
reach may make the difference between a humiliating loss or a glorious triumph.

   The Player's Mother will be there during the whole adventure and, once you get a Starter Pokemon at Rustel City's Pokemon Lab, she will heal all your Pokemon whenever you want.
   Also, keep in mind that next door lives the Player's fiancee, Keira.
She will assist the player in case of great difficulty.
If you run out of money, or if your pocket is almost empty, she will give you some PokeMoney borrowed
from her billionaire father.
Furthermore, if for some reason you don't have any Pokemon but one, she will be happy to
give you a Pokemon! She is perhaps very fond of the protagonist.

   Once you arrive in Rustel City, you will be approached by Prof.Bek, and your errand will start.
You will receive your first Pokemon, a Starter Pokemon, and you will be confronted by your nemesis,
Paul (the same from the Pokemon animation series), the player's rival. You'd better win.
   Before leaving Rustel City you may want to visit the nearby Pokemon Mart in order to deliever
a mysterious parcel to Prof.Bek. Once this task is accomplished you will receive the PokeDex,
the device used to store info about the Pokemon you catch.
This tool may be essential for your quest since there are over 240 Pokemon species, and you don't want to
stumble into confusion, right? Oh, the glorious days when Pokemon species were below half a thousand!

   Do not freak out if all your favourite legendaries Pokemon aren't there (despite the fact that
there's already a notable amount of them -- with relative unique events) because all Pokemon
species will be interesting in their own terms: there is no real weak Pokemon once you manage
to make it stronger, or to evolve it if that's the case.

   Remember, you will travel across two regions -- Frejo and Kelgo, each one with its unique Town Map.
There are many secrets to unravel and discover along the way: these secret achievements may make you
stronger, thus making your journey far less unforgiving.
   You see, your quest scenario isn't that linear: due to its geometry, Frejo whirls itself up like
in a true open world, and many areas have to be back-tracked due to secrets that might have been out
of reach. Beware, because there any many traps, pitfalls, and tricks along the way that you would
not have previously imagined!

   And, even after completing the First Quest up to the Pokemon League, there are two additional main
quests: the Second Quest and the Hidden Quest; with the exception of the Second Quest (that will be
available after the First one), all quests are somehow intertwined between them, leaving many many many
things to explore and try. In addition, completing the PokeDex counts as a quest in its own.
There's plenty of gameplay in there, without a doubt much more than in the original
Pokemon Red (and much more than in the original Pokemon games, even some of the latter ones).
Probably Pokemon Grape is one of the longest pokemon games to complete for 100% completion without
cheating due to its enormous amount of backtracking, alternative scenarios, and secrets.
You can keep an eye on how many Quests you have completed on your Trainer Card: for each quest
you have completed a Star will be added to your Card, as in the newest Pokemon games.

   From here onwards, it's up to you!
Speak to every character and bystander in order to have some hints and tips on your next destination.

   Gotta Catch 'em all!

		~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
				Release History
		~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
   This is a hack ROM based on Pokemon Red (USA).
The author is 80C and this was his first ROM hack.
Pokemon Grape started out as an elaborate school prank sometime around 2000-2001.
That project never saw the light, until it was eventually re-started from scratch.

   Pokemon Grape's development began in 2012, it saw 3 Demo releases:
"Demo 1" and "Demo2" were released in 2013.
"Demo 3" was released on Christmas 2014, while its expansion,
"Demo 3.1", was released on Summer 2015.
Each Demo release featured huge differences and improvements.

   The first Final Version (1.0) was published on December 31st 2019.
The game then received a considerable amount of fixes in the following weeks,
which led to Final 1.4 on January 20th 2020, the first "stable" version of success.
   Later on, in the same the year, the Final 1.5 was released on April 2020:
it extended the game and added a massive amount of new features.
That was the version most of the public knew and played between 2020 and 2021.

		~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
				  Overview
		~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
   This is a Total Overhaul hack that drastically changes the original game,
beyond recognition, and it features advanced Assembly Features -
most of them have been implemented for the first time in a Gen.1 Hack ROM
like Phisical-Special split attack, new evolution methods etc. etc. etc.
Later hacks, mostly 1st and 2nd Generation hacks (but even hacks based
on later Generations) were notably influenced by this hack.

   A few events of the game are similar to the events that occour in
Pokemon Red\Blue (altought in a different order); those similarities
however are to be explained later in the game's storyline.
The hack is pretty hard, especially at the beginning of the game,
and the gameplay experience offers way more hours of gameplay than
the original Red Version (and perhaps even more than a few newer games).

   This is the last hack that has been realized with obsolete methods
like hex editing, manual repointing, byte-by-byte programming etc.
Many fans considered this hack the "spiritual successor" of classic retrò
Pokemon Hacks like Pokemon Brown and Pokemon Team Rocket Edition and,
in facts, this hack constitutes the turning point, or the bridge,
between these classic hacks and the more sophisticated ones from later years.

   Actually, Pokemon Grape is widely considered by both critics and fans
around the world one of the best Gen.1 hack ever made, and one of the best ones
regardless of the game engine on which is based, standing aside even with
hacks based on the 3rd Generation of Pokemon games. It even won several prizes
and contests online during the mid-2010s, with the last Demo receiving
critical acclaim worldwide.
   Ultimately, Pokemon Grape splits the age of Pokemon fangames into two:
before Pokemon Grape and after Pokemon Grape.

   Blah blah blah, now let's get started.

 ° Note: The story is largely accessory, and it is indeed a pure pretext.
What truly matters here is the gaming experience.
Furthermore, it turns out that many characters are unreliable narrators.
The following one is a backstory that is mentioned by several NPCs in the
first parts of the game.
~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
   Welcome to the Region of Frejo!

   It's 1999, and you will impersonate a former baseball player who has to take part
in a deadly competition that will establish once for all the ownership of the Pokemon League,
which is located on a contended territory between two regions, Frejo and Kelgo.
In order to avoid a military escalation, the chiefs of the two regions decide to organize
a sort of tournament: each one chooses a rookie trainer as contender (in order not to create
too much disadvantage between each other), which represents one of the regions.

   Your player stands as the Frejo contender. Your rival is the Kelgo contender who,
quite surprisingly, is another boy from Frejo: Paul, the son of a local mobster
associated with Team Rocket that managed to escape from Kanto with some of his associates
after the failed "Silph Coup" in Saffron City the previous year.
It is heavily implied that the Region of Kelgo is trying to sabotate the Competition by
assuming the local Team Rocket mobsters, but apparently this is not enough for them.

   Indeed, the night before the competition would have started, "some bad guys" from
Team Rocket enter the Pokemon League and erase all the Pokemon Data from its Mainframe,
triggering economic disruptions as a consequence for the loss of this Pokemon data --
economic and bureaucratical stuff the players aren't supposed to comprehend.
Thus, at the last minute it is decided that the contenders will be aided by Professor Bek
(mispelled by the Anagraph Office: his name was "Professor Tek"), who will give the
contenders a PokeDex so that they can retrieve the missing PokeMon Data back.

   This looks quite simple, but matters are complicated by the presence of an
occult sect that goes by the name of "Epsilon", which is apparently secretly
controlling this Frejo branch of Team Rocket. The Epsilonists are probably
helping the Region of Kelgo, but this is never disclosed overtly (altough it's implied).
Its leader, Kifflom, is both trying to sabotage the Region of Frejo and to put
into practise his evil masterplan: the "Epsilon Program". Somehow it has to do with
a newly discovered legendary Pokemon, Driadjin, the Guardian of the Region of Frejo.

The winner takes all.

   Speaking of R/B/Y-based hacks, Pokemon Grape was the hack that introduced most new
important features for the first time than any other hack released before its publication.
Regardless of platform/engine, in terms of important additions Grape stands even aside
3rd-generation hacks, something that was unthinkable back then for a Gen.1 hack.
Only Pokemon Vega, Prism, and few others can claim such a primate, especially considering
that many new features introduced for the first time in this hack are now staples in (almost)
every more recent hack (e.g: new evolution methods, new items with brand new functions,
phisical/special split, etc).
   Of course, as times went on it is not anymore "the" one that introduced the most features ever,
yet it is still almost there: indeed, so many changes are featured that a Sub-Category for
each addition is needed in this Section to keep track of each addition.
   Keep in mind that, since this a total reworking of the original game, nearly everything
has been changed, thus it is nearly impossible to list each small modification. Therefore,
only the most notable and major additions are listed here.
   See also the next sections for further information and details.

  the regular battling Mode as a secret prize (@@).
* Battle Tower, like in Pokemon Crystal (in this version it's only maps, tough);
* Nuzlocke-Exclusive areas (@@) (Auto-Nuzlocke Mode isn't
  implemented yet in this version, tough).
* The three legendary dogs roaming around the Region after a certain event,
  active the event and you'll eventually find Roaming Pokemon!
* Scouter item that beeps if a roaming Pokemon is in your area (@@) and that
  can aid in finding roaming pokemon (@@).
* Elaborate new scripts and events completely absent from the original games;
* More emotion bubbles, used more often than in the original game for special
  effects in the course of many events and/or dialogues (@).
* Move Deleter NPC (@).
* Move Tutor NPC.
* "Pokemon Smeller" NPC: she can detect the last Pokemon you've encountered (@@).
* There are many shapshots and figurative art that can be osserved in gameplay.
* Hilarious dialogues, humour and tons of "pop culture" references.
* Occasional self-censored profanity, Conker's-Bad-Fur-Day Style (@@), after all
  this game is a parody of Pokemon and the video-gaming culture.

* New Objects implemented, many of them even have new functions,
  like the Lighter, Magic Hammer, Cottage, and much more (@).
(I wrote the tutorial that made it possible in other Gen.1 hacks).
* Hold Item mechanics -- I've programmed this feature by myself from scratch:
  it was time for me to finally learn to do the programmer's job accordingly.
  Contrary to popular opinion, the first one to achieve this feature in Gen.1
  was Uac.Dario, I ought to be fair to an exceptional hacker (and mentor).
  I possibly could have not programmed this feature myself without his teachings
  about ASM and the GameBoy Color back in the days.
* Hold Everstone: the Pokemon holding it will not evolve (@).
* Kart instead of Bicycle :) (@).
* Magic Hammer (as in "Zelda: A Link to the Past") (@@).
* Mining System and Item extraction from caves from the Gen.4 Games (@).
* Cottage (from the Final Fantasy series): if the conditions are met, it fully
 heals your entire party (@@).
* New PokeBall types with new features, Fast, Dive, Nest, Net Balls, with
 the addition of Shiny Ball for turning Pokemon into shinies, Dope Ball for
 boosting their stats and some newly added PokeBalls with functionalities
 applied for the first time in this hack (@): Heal, Dusk, Timer, and Repeat Balls!
* Snag Ball: You can steal other people's Pokemon!
* Improved PokeBall usage.
* New items used for Pokemon evolution.
* De-Stone (as in "Pokemon Dark Energy"), used to de-evolve the "Eeveelutions" (@).
* An Item Diviner is capable of correctly guessing the last Item you've used! (@@).

* Over 240 different Pokemon Species including Pokemon from Kanto,
  Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova and Kalos, along with 2 new Fakemon.
* 10 Extra types: Steel, Dark, Fairy, Atom, Wood, Wind, Gas, Sound,
  Light and Bone... Whoa, too much for my brain!
* New evolution methods adapted from further generation along with
  new methods of evolution (@@) - This has been the first Pokemon hack rom
  with such implementation;
* Pokemon Barber NPC: he can do a haircut on your Pokemon for a fee. This
  way you can evolve a few Pokemon species that in the Official games evolve
  through Happyness Level increasing, including Eevee into Umbreon/Espeon (@@);
* Evolution through Held Item (@, based on the original R/B/Y engine);
* Each Pokemon has completely new High-Quality sprites devamped from
  later games (100% Front Sprites are by the Author, back sprites are mostly
  from G/S/C) and each pokemon uses its own palette, matching Gen3 colors
  (with *lots* of dithering).
  Side note: Front sprites were drawn with MSPaint without devamp aid O_O .
* Each backsprite can use a different palette from the usual one, widening
  the display of the Pokemon colors - most notably with Shellder, Shellgon,
  Staryu, Ivysaur, Venusaur, and many others.
* Compatibility with Gen.1, Gen.2 games, and even certain other hacks (somehow).

* 70 extra new Moves, including moves that use the new types
  (at least 3 damage dealing moves for each new type).
* Phisical\Special Split attack (@) this has been the first Gen.1 hack rom
  with such implementation. While not the first ever platform/engine-wise to
  implement this feature, players had nonetheless a chance of experiencing and
  playing with this feature for the first time ever in this hack since the old Demo3.
* Damage Counter during battles in Final Fantasy-fashion (@@) Thanks to Uac.Dario!
* EXP Bar - Thanks to Danny-E 33 for the original version of the asm routine.

* The Bag menu was overhauled, both in aesthetics and functions:
 ° Once you select an Item in the bag, an Item description is automatically (@) shown,
 ° a Pic of the Item you have selected is shown, too, of any Item (@@, excluding Gen3+).
 ° If you have selected a TM or an HM, the move it contains is shown without having
 to use the Item (@).
 ° Added a counter in the Bag that keeps track of how many "pockets" for each Item you
 have in the bag is occupied so that players know in advance if the bag is full (@@).
* The trainer Card shows you the amount of Quests you have completed (@@), and
  it shows you which Power Gem you have collected and how many are there (@@).
* Game Play Time updated automatically in the Trainer Card (@).
* Colored and shaded fonts (@);
* Dark Fonts and even Braille Fonts! (@);
* Switchable and selectable textboxes (@);
* A fourth text speed included: MAX speed, leaving no delay between letters (@);
* Extra intro screens before the standard introduction;
* Custom Mini-Sprites in the Pokemon menu, one for each Pokemon species -
  uses a unique ASM routine different from Pokemon Maize and Pokemon T.R.E. 2
 (and was featured since Demo3, 2 and half years before the "final" Prism was released).
* Unique Textbox and un-shaded fonts in Battles (@@).

			|     Miscellaneous    |

* Several glitches left there by the original developers were fixed.
  See the next section below for further details.
* You'll find that a lot of secondary characters have a whole backstory
  behind them, which may or may not involve the plot, indeed, this is not a
  game featuring the story "save the princess and slay the Dragonking",
  although it may seem like so since this game is poking fun at it;
* And much more, too much to be listed here.

   Known issues with this game mostly (or, better, exclusively) regard the in-battle flaws
inherited from the original R/B/Y games since the 1st Generation battle engine is notoriously
messy and glitched. Many of the worst glitches were fortunately fixed but, still, there are
SO many that it takes quite a long time to effectively eradicate those errors, especially
considering how difficult is moving around data in the space dedicated to the Battle engine.
   Until I re-work the Battle engine radically (which might take a very long time), the following
are the known flaws that are either inherited from the original Pokemon Red or are the
result of oversights that come about because of faulty coding that, due to luck, did not
show up in other circumstancies in the "stock" game engine.

* The "Dual-Type effectiveness message" quirks were inherited from the original Pokemon Red/Blue.
  It is not fixed yet, as it will take some time (I have to rework the 1st Gen. fighting engine,
  which is notoriously messed up beyond modern taste and approval).

* A few flaws of the fighting system left by the original Devs are still there, for example
  the various Counter glitches and similar. I have fixed a few, tough (most notably, I
  was the first one to fix the very annoying Transform-Glitch/Ditto Assumption glitch).
  Look at the next paragraph for details.

* Status-dealing and condition-dealing moves do not account for type effectiveness.
 (e.g: Poisoning Steel-types and the likes). Neither special-damage moves do, for example
 Psywave or (notoriously) Dragon Rage. This was already there in R/B/Y.

* When the rival Pokemon uses Mirror Move it will not mirror all the newly added moves.
   ° This bug happens only if the rival Pokemon is using Mirror Move.
  Since the game is hard-coded in such a way that the Move animation is treated the same as
  the move ID in a few instances, Mirror Move will mirror the wrong move, mirroring the
  move whose animation is shared with the new moves (e.g: using Bounce, it will mirror Fly).
  Yes, it is another loathful result of the stock fighting engine, which will take a very
  long while to fix and update.

[m5:a]
	~~~~~   ~~~~~   ~~~~~   ~~~~~   ~~~~~   ~~~~~   ~~~~~
	Fixed Bugs originally found in "Pokemon: Red Version"
	~~~~~   ~~~~~   ~~~~~   ~~~~~   ~~~~~   ~~~~~   ~~~~~
   Many of these were first-time fixes: most notably,
the Ditto Assumption, Glitch City, Walk-Through-Walls, Cable-Club-Escape,
SaveReset Oversight, Names Issues, Door Tile sound oversights, Using Repels upon
Repels, 1st Gym Skipping, Cycling Road Skipping, Safari Zone PA-System Glitches,
Safari Zone steps-decreasing issues, and several more.

(Apparently no one noticed the Door Sound Oversight before 80C did, so it is
likely that, at the time of writing this document, this minor oversight isn't
listed among the officially discovered Pokemon Red/Blue glitches. In short,
in the original games, doors in a few Tilesets use the wrong sound effect if
walked upon, for example in the Safari Zone).

° No more glitchy east-coast tile that makes weird wild Pokemon spawn,
 therefore, no MissingNo glitch.
 Surfing on the western coast tile spawns the same pokemon you will find
 by surfing on the regular water tile.
This also fixed A LOT of other related glitches (for example, the "Safari Trick");
° Obviously, no "Safari Trick" (See above).
° No Glitch City :P
° Fixed the "Safari Zone PA-System Glitch", fixing a lot of related glitches
 in the process (like the Walk-Through-Walls glitch).
° Fixed the Walk-Thru-Walls Glitch once for all (See above).
° Safari Zone's specialty and novelties (step decreasing, walking counter, etc.)
 are applied only when a Safari session is paid first, meaning that a lot of
 glitches involving safari zone are all fixed.
° Added a notable fix for the "Transform Glitch": Pokemon caught during
 the Transformed state, either by using Transform, Metronome, or Mirror Move
 will retain their original Identity upon capture, they won't turn any longer
 into Ditto (Fixed the "Ditto assumption" glitch).
° Fixed the "Evolutionary Stone Bypassing" Glitch.
° Fixed the Evolutionary Stones potentially testing for any newly inserted evolution method.
° The so-called "Save Reset Oversight" involving the cycling road has been fixed.
° Fixed the infamous "Cable Club Escape Glitch".
° Fixed a lot of routines that handled water in the overworld.
° Fixed the "1st Gym Skipping Sequence".
° Fixed the "Ghost Marowak Skipping" also known as the "PokeDoll Oversight"
  (can be witnessed since Final 1.6, I forgot during the years to make it available).
° No Cycling Road Block skipping :P
° Fixed the "Statue Fishing Glitch", you cannot use the fishing rod in unfit places.
° Fixed the "Names Issue" glitches, in the original games it affected glitch Items and
  "Invalid" MissingNo's, but because of additions it could potentially affect stuff.
° Fixed an oversight left there by the original developers, for which Item effects overflowed
  past the 128th: from the 129th item onwards the item effects were erroneously "recycled"
  from the 1st Item (Master Ball) onwards (I had discovered this one).
  In the original game it only affected glitch Items, but here it had to be fixed.
° No "invisible PC access" :P
° No "Oak Poke Ball delivery text overlapping".
° No Elixier\Ether glitch in case you raise PPs with a PP-Up.
° You cannot use another repel if the last used one is still active.
° Focus Energy and Dire Hit are no longer glitched.
° Issues with PokeBalls and improper catch rate computation were fixed.
° Substitute no longer has a chance of making its user faint by leaving it with 0 HP.
° Fly, Dig, Dive and Bounce have invulnerability status and a custom message each.
° Using Rest now also clears the badly poisoned state (and its multiplier).
° Leech Seed is no longer effective against the target's substitute.
° Swift cannot hit any longer Pokemon during an invulnerable state.
° Sleeping now lasts for a maximum of 3 turns (instead of 7).
° Fixed a minor issue involving the mis-matched sound effects of doors and stairs;
° All moves have been updated up to the later games, a few of them however
 keep their original damage (like Surf, Flamethrower, etc.) as I thought it was more
 convenient not to worsen them any further, Blizzard has a 30% of freezing chance like
 in the original Japanese versions, Tackle behaves like in Gen.8 games;
° All Critical Hit Moves now have a higher critical hit accordingly, with a few more
 addition (notably Dragon Claw and a few of the newly added ones);
° After using Transform the palette color will be corrected as soon as
 you either look at the party Pokemon or wait a few turns;
° No Super-Glitch Move (TMTrainer-Glitch or whatever);
° Five-digit experience gain is no longer printed incorrectly.
° When you save the game the menu isn't kept open if you keep either the A or B Button
 pressed.
° MissingNo. #000 (M'Block) has been _partially_ fixed, you won't encounter
 him in any way during normal gameplay though;
° A lot of other minor fixes that actually I don't remember and are either
 unnoticeable in regular gameplay or impossible to mention on this ReadMe alone;

[6a:3] 3) New evolutive chains previously not found on the original games;

 ° Note: This game features, for the first time ever in a Pokemon hack, new
methods of evolutions that differ from the original Pokemon games.
Most of them are based on methods introduced in the later Pokemon games.
These methods include:
* Levelling up in a specific map/area;
* Levelling up knowing a particular move;
* The relationship between the Attack and Defense stats of a Pokemon (Tyrogue);
* Levelling up a Pokemon holding a specific Item;
* Giving your Pokemon a Haircut through a Barber NPC;
* Daylight/Night-Time evolution through Haircut;

				   New Type Chart
				~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ° Note For Glitch-Hunters and Technical g33ks: "Bird"-type is still
left there unused in the game -- sentimental purpose and in-joke only.

   Keeping in mind that the elementar types and the related damage calculations
are no longer affected by the type alone (thanks to the phisical-special split
those calculations are now affected by the phisical or special nature of the move itself),
the following are the elementar Types featured in the game:

~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
*  = Official Type, not there in the Original Pokemon Red/Blue;
** = Newly added non-canonical Type;
~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
Type Name	Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Normal		Specimens in which no particular element or matter prevails.
Fighting	These species are especially suited for phisical struggle.
Flying		Species in which the capability of Flying is a crucial aspect.
Poison		These species naturally embrace the realm of venoms and toxins.
Ground		Specimens whose characteristics are related to the soil.
Rock		Species that are explicitly made of stone material.
Ghost		These species are supposed to belong to the otherworldly dimension!
Steel *		Despite the name, it includes all species mostly made of metals.
Fire		These Pokemon are capable of spontaneous combustion.
Water		Pokemon of the marine habitat and/or able to manipulate water.
Grass		Pokemon that share a phisiology with the (secret?) life of plants.
Electric	These species are capable of generating and manipulating electricity.
Psychic		Pokemon that are capable of using hidden mind-generated powers!
Ice		Species related to, or even capable to attain, low temperatures.
Dragon		These reptilians share the peculiar traits of those mythical beasts.
Dark  *		Furtive, nocturnal-dwelling species with an attraction to darkness.
Fairy *		Share characteristics that are ascribed to the realm of magic.
Atom  **	Pokemon whose structure is either highly unstable and/or synthetic.
Wood  **	These species are explicitly made of the hard bark matter of trees.
Wind  **	Specimens directly related to atmospherical phenomena and airflow.
Gas   **	Species whose nature reflects the phisics and chemistry of gases.
Sound **	These creatures embrace the acoustics and properties of sound.
Light **	Creatures directly related to light spectra, including UV and its heat.
Bone  **	Specimens whose bone structure prevails on the overall matter.

Here is the Type Chart showing the type effectiveness' combinations:

   The following list includes only the newly introduced moves.
The moves originally found in Pokemon Red\Blue weren't removed or replaced;
however, those moves were updated to match the most recent games' parameters --
with the exception of Blizzard, which has a 30% chance of freezing like in the
original Japanese version of Pokemon Red\Green.
   Note also that the newly introduced moves do not mirror exactly the moves
introduced in Generation 2 games since some of those were imported from later games
while other moves are completely new and (perhaps) unique to this game.

   In this section you will find out the basics "How to..." for this game.
Exceptionally, since this game is so difficult to beat/figure out, especially
in the latest areas of the game (unless you cheat), I decided to include a
quite comprehensive series of Quest Scenario Question/Hints.
Remember that Grape is the equivalent of the 1980s-scrap-brains RPGs where you
have to take note of everything (not as much as "Wizardry" but almost there).

Q: I have a question... etc. etc. etc...
A: First, have a look at the other paragraphs in this FAQ.
 Your question is probably already here.
 Alternatively, you can ask other people who played this game --
 my favourite choice, being this also a good way of interacting
 with real people exchanging a common interest.

Keep in mind that your question might have been already answered in
 this document, so do not bother other players with an already-asked
 question (because people often seem irritated when this happens).
 Therefore, if that is possible, you'd better search on the Web first.

---------
Q: I'm stuck in this part of the game, etc. etc. etc...
A: Look at the "Quest Scenario" Sub-Section of this FAQ.
 If you're still stuck you can browse online -- most of the times
 you'll figure out just by searching. Keep in mind that a lot of
 puzzles aren't that obvious and they require plain trial and
 error to solve them.

---------
Q: How do I report a bug\glitch\oversight?
A: This is a legitimate and very good question.
 A short description of the phenomenon, the area\map\circumstance where
 it was found and at least a pic should do it, either via private message
 on the last place I were active or, even better, publicly for the whole
 world to see so other players can take note of it and possibly avoid
 the reported glitch/bug/oversight.

From time to time I end up reading your messages, and I also read random
 discussions, messages, pics and\or videos by users (usually when it's too late),
 either way I usually fix each known bug in the next release\upgrade.
 Keep in mind that I do not want to update too often -- only when a good amount
 of oversights has been detected so I can fix all of these in time for the next
 upgrade. Bear patience, I'm only one.

---------
Q: How do I play this game?
A: Please read carefully the "How to play" section on this manual.

---------
Q: Pokemon Grape doesn't work on my emulator! Why!?
A: There may be various reasons that have to do with your device,
 in that case you have to verify first that you have got everything needed
 (eg. all the needed extensions for running the emulators, like .dll files, etc).

Second, usually people commit mistakes while patching and\or doing settings.
 Did you patch the game correctly?
 Did you patch the right ROM (Pokemon Red Version (USA) v1.0 [!])?
 Are you sure that the ROM you have was not already patched\modified?
 Are you sure that the ROM you have is not damaged or corrupted and so on?
 Is your emulator supported in your smartphone and\or computing device?
 Is your emulator running?
 Is your emulator missing a needed .dll file or anything?
 Have you selected the right ROM?
 Is the archive in which your ROM is archived damaged or unaccessible?
 Did you select the right Emulator Option (Automatic\SGB)?
 Is your monitor turned on?

---------
Q: The game froze as soon as I opened it!
A: Are you sure that the ROM you have was not already patched?
 Are you sure that the ROM you have is not damaged\corrupted and so on?
 I knew of people patching Pokemon Yellow for mistake,
 some patched it on a different localization of Pokemon Red,
 a few ones were patching older versions of Pokemon Grape,
 and (alas) many others instead were trying to patch it on Pokemon Fire Red
 because they thought there was no difference at all... 

---------
Q: Can I play this game on my smartphone\cellphone?
A: Yes, albeit you cannot play the game on the phone by itself,
 unless you run it on an emulator that is fit for your smartphone\device etc.
 It seems that nowadays (2020s) several of these are finally available,
 and such new mobile emulators do not even require to convert the game into
 akward file formats (like the old ones did).

---------
Q: Whaaa- Why is the game in gray scale colors!?
A: This happens when you emulate the game on Game Boy Original as the
 emulator "downgrades" the game to run on that platform which didn't feature
 palettes but only 2 shades of grey (and not 50... Sorry, bad joke).
 This happened in the Demos even when playing in GBC mode, because in those
 development versions Grape wasn't "upward compatible", unlike the Final Version.
 The Final Version in facts is automatically colorized while running on
 Game Boy Color or superior backward-compatible hardware like the
 Game Boy Advance (and perhaps newer retro-emulators and extensions).

This happens because Original Game Boy games were supposed to
 be in black\white; fortunately, Game Freak developers decided to
 add compatibility with the Super Game Boy, an add-on for the SNES
 that allows it to play Game Boy games, even enabling many exclusive
 features such as colorization and borders if those were provided
 in the game (a concept similar to the Sega CD and the ill-fated Sega 32X).

Pokemon Grape, since Final Version 1.0, is automatically colored
 as Game Boy Color altough it is a Game Boy Original ROM with
 backward compatible Super Game Boy functionalities -- somehow like
 Pokemon Yellow, yet more advanced -- so this issue is unlikely to
 happen unless the emulator is forced on Original Game Boy Mode.

On the BGB emulator the game is automatically ran on SGB (Super Game Boy)
 mode so it is automatically colored, altought it is slightly different
 than in Color Mode: the palettes are slightly brighter, and in the title
 screen the protagonist and scrolling pokemon are of the same color.
This happens because Super Game Boy (without an adequate addition) does not
 support distinct colorization of the VideoRAM OBJ Layer from other
 VRAM Banks -- in short (at least by using the "stock" SGB package featured
 in Pokemon R/B/Y) sprites cannot get different colors from the background,
 at least in games ran on SGB Mode...
Yet, there is a catch: at some point during the developement of the SGB,
 it seemed that this would have been possible by using the SNES Video RAM
 but, apparently, no developer ever did that, although it _should_ be possible.

---------
Q: Whaaaa- Pokemon and\or Menus sometimes have weird colors!
A: It happened on one notorious case where the player "accidentally"
 loaded a save state from an older version rather than saving on the
 older version and reloading from there -- a result of an oversight.
 Save States are renown for being compatible only if the game's
 versions match exactly... And this doesn't even happen all the times.

---------
Q: Why is my save game corrupted?
A: Unfortunately, the Final versions of Pokemon Grape aren't retrocompatible
 with the previous Demos (in particular with Demo 2.x and Demo 3.x).
 Therefore, in this version you have to start a new game. Accept my apologies.
 That's the price for having introduced some nifty stuff like unique events
 involving legendaries (and a SRAM fix involving an oversight left there
 by GameFreak, arghhh, I have to correct the originators themselves some times!).

Later revisions will be compatible with the Version Final 1.x
 although many minor fixable issues may arise if you'll switch
 to a deeply upgraded version, in such cases the Save Game will be
 still compatible and I'll give instructions on how to fix
 those issues involving retrocompatibility, but at least for now
 you don't have to mind about it.

Nonetheless, the game's experience has changed a lot, even from
 the beginning of the game, since the game was vastly improved since the previous Demos.
 In any case, starting a new game is the best solution.

---------
Q: I loaded my savestate and everything went crazy! Why!?
A: You must have loaded a Savestate from a wrong version or from a previous version.
 Save States are renown for being compatible only if the game's versions
 match exactly... And this doesn't even happen all the times.
 Do not attempt that trick unless you want your Lv.100 Charizard to turn into a
 Lv.05 Magikarp. I even had infamous reports of "shifting carpets" that danced to
 the rhytm of the 8bit music or maps flooded with walking people that were raining
 from the top of the screen. The disturbances brought about by the faulty use of
 statesaves are oftentimes creepy.

           		 Quest Scenario Questions
		~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--------- [Types]
Q: I can't figure out the newly added types!
A: Well, at times neither I can ;)
 You can look the Type Chart found in the "Utilities" section
 on this manual. There was also some "Type Chart.png" file hanging
 around somewhere on the web for a better visual clue. It should have been
 included in your download since Final 1.6.
Side note: even better, you can print your "New Type Chart" on paper so you
 can have it at all times (and, when you're done, remember to recycle
 your paper).

--------- [Moves \ TMs]
Q: I can't figure out the newly added moves and\or TMs!
A: Still more understandable than the new types ;P
 Look at the Utilities section on this manual, in there you will
 find all information regarding Moves and TMs\HMs.

--------- [PokeBalls]
Q: How many PokeBall types are there, and how do they work?
A: In Pokemon Grape the usual PokeBall types are still there,
 for instance PokeBall, Great, Ultra, Safari and the Master Ball
 of course. In addition, 12 new PokeBall types were added; below
 here are the new PokeBalls and their function:
* Fast Ball	- Increased efficiency on fast Pokemon;
* Net Ball	- Increased efficiency on Bug or Water Pokemon;
* Dive Ball	- " if used in underwater maps;
* Nest Ball	- " on Pokemon with low levels;
* Repeat Ball	- " on already caught PokeMon species;
* Timer Ball	- " depending on GamePlay Hours, the higher the best;
* Heal Ball	- It completely heals the caught Pokemon upon capture;
* Dusk Ball	- Increased efficiency if used in dark areas (or at night);
* Shiny Ball	- This ball makes the caught Pokemon shiny;
		As of now it only sets the pokemon's IV to parameters
		matching the ones shared by Shiny Pokemon as the Shiny
		Pokemon feature is absent from Final Version 1.x;
* Dope Ball	- This ball makes the caught Pokemon very strong;
* Clone Ball	- This ball turns the caught Pokemon into an HM Clone,
	An HM Clone is a weak Pokemon meant only as a mean for
	learning HM field moves, it's very weak and it won't grow
	stats and Strength at all. The advantage is that the player doesn't
	have restrictions on using the Clone Ball in a Nuzlocke Run and,
	as a consequence, this ball is a nuzlocke-only exclusive item.
		Reminder: Automatic Nuzlocke Mode isn't featured yet in
		Final Version 1.x, so this ball is useless;
* Snag Ball	- This ball is capable of stealing an opposing trainer's
	Pokemon, effectively ending the battle upon capture, no matter
	who the opposing trainer is. 
	Side Note: I programmed it in such a way that in a Nuzlocke Run its rules
	apply even to this ball - meaning you can only steal a Pokemon per
	area providing that you haven't already caught (or stolen) another
	one in a previous occasion.

--------- [Gyms]
Q: Where do I find the Gym I'm looking for?
A: I received TONS of questions regarding Gym location.
 Well, since in Pokemon Grape some Gyms are harder to find
 than in the regular Pokemon Games, here's a list for you:

1- Megan City 		> Elias
 The easiest one to find. Make sure the monitor is on.
 You cannot even skip it as it involves a part of the storyline.

2- Cherry City 		> Ellie
 Enter the Mega Mart and look for the Elevator, enter and go down
 to the Basement (B1F) where you will find an emergency exit.
 Follow the path and you will find yourself atop Cherry City's
 mountain, but beware: Paul is waiting for you.

3- Snorkel City 	> Liquid
 Another easy one to find, it's on the main route.
 However, unlike what happened with the Demos, here you cannot
 proceed past Route 63 skipping this Gym because a guard will block your
 path unless you have defeated the Gymleader.

4- Buris City		 > Grace
 Apparently, it's the hardest one to find.
 Enter the game corner and turn on the secret switch behind the
 poster, it will move out a (fake) vending machine revealing a
 staircase! Do not leave the building, or it will reset.
 Enter there and get ready to defeat a grunt, then proceed and
 you will find yourself beside the Gym. Side note: Yes, when you
 get out of there by going backwards the player will pop out in
 front of the vending machine! I found this too funny so I left it :)

5- Paceleaf City	 > Slye
 Many players accidentally skip this Gym but will usually
 return there after 2 hours of gameplay because they cannot use
 Surf without having earned the fifth badge :P
 The Gym is easy to find, although you can only access it if you
 have earned the first four badges.

6- Gondwan City	 	> Waspia
 It seems that most native English speakers cannot pronounce this
 City's name at all. Can I do it? Me neither! How frustrating.
 The Gym is located on an area accessible only with Surf, in the
 northern part of the City. Beside you will find the Fisher Guru's
 House that acts as a Route Gate too. How useful.

7- Silten City		> Dante
 Another easy one to find.
 Simply defeat the Rocket grunts on Weapon Depot so you can access
 this Gym.
 However, when I said "simply" it doesn't necessarily mean it will
 be simple. Unless you cheated or grinded for hours, of course.

8- Lauras City		 > ???
 This City is easy to find but unlocking and entering the Gym itself
 will be quite hard, even for the manic pro-skilled players.
 First, you have to earn the Grip Shoes from the President on 5F of the
 Weapon Depot (from Final 1.6 onwards). In the previous version, you
 received the item after helping Leon\Elza in Haven City (now she 
 gives you the Train Pass instead from Final 1.6 onwards).

Now, for the hard part: you will have to solve a boulder maze by
 manovrating a boulder across a cave by using Strength -- and that
 means recovering the HM04 first by finding the Lost Translater in
 the Safari Zone and giving it to the Ranger in Gadow City, not an
 easy task considering that the House is only accessible thru Uri
 Tunnel, whose access is (partially hidden) on Route 65. 

9- The Gym in Quartz Town
 The Gym in there is not an official Pokemon League Gym as it is
 located in another Region (actually more of a special district),
 the Region of Altek, hence no badge.
 However, there's still a prize to claim in there.
 Simply Surf westwards across the small lake in Quartz Town, then
 follow the short route to the Gym, and be ready for a surprise.

10- There was a Tenth Gym...
 The Tenth Gym in Haven City goes as an unused cameo, as of now.
 Previously, a special feature was intended here for this place,
 but it was eventually replaced by the "Bounty Killer Sidequest"
 in Hardat City. In the future this place may host something
 different altogether, since as of now it is totally useless.

--------- [HM Locations]
Q: Where is the HM I'm looking for?
A: HMs are slightly harder to find due to the explorative nature
 of this game: you will have to search a lot of things as Frejo is
 shock full of hidden places.

1 - Cut
The HM is located inside the Mart Ruins on Route 53 and it will
 involve a small quest that features your rival looting shamelessly
 and barbarically the mart, and he's angry as never before.
 Defeat Paul then head downstairs and talk to the Chief, he will
 reward you with the HM01.

2 - Fly
The Flight House is located on Route 60, despite of this, the
 area can only be accessed through Wizard Peak's Wormhole located
 on Route 71, beside Wizard Peak's exit.
 The best thing to do is to recover it as soon as you rescue Mr.Abe
 from Spooky Swamp because the Flight House's access is blocked by
 a Snorlax, so get your PokeFlute and awake it (gulp!), then enter
 the house and the previously trapped flight-girl will give you the HM02.

3 - Surf
You will have to reach the furthest area of the Alpine Mansion
 in Quartz Town, the HM comes in the form of an Item Ball and
 it is placed at the very end of the dungeon. 

4 - Strength (Yes, because I have finally learnt to spell it)
This is a hard one and it involves a small quest in its own.
 Enter Safari Zone and carefully, without wasting steps, search
 for the lost Translater; once you have found it, get all way back
 to route 65 and surf southwards to find a large dungeon called
 Uri Tunnel.
 Reach the other side of Uri Tunnel and you will be beside the
 Pokemon Ranger's House, the one that talks with that hilarious
 wannabe-vietnamese speech (Remember "Vietnamese Crystal"? Sort-of).
 Give him the translater and he will hand you the HM04.

5 - Flash
Bek's Aide on Route 56 will award you a HM05 if you have
 caught at least 20 species of Pokemon. A frustrating HM.
 If you're afraid of collecting it, or if for some reason
 you can't manage to get a Pokemon that can learn flash
 (impossible since you can always buy that Mareep from Rustel
 City's PokeCenter) then you can look for a Lighter hidden
 in Wizard Peak.

6 - Dive
The brand new HM awaits for you in Haven City, Region of Kelgo.
 Look for the Fisher Guru's Brother's House.

--------- [Pokemon Locations]
Q: Where are the Pokemon I'm looking for?
A: Simply use a PokeDex to locate Pokemon locations!
 Keep in mind that only Pokemon from Frejo are displayed
 (You have to find the Kelgo ones by yourself).

By the way, every Pokemon specie featured in this hack can be
 obtained in its own way. Look for every area in the game,
 and keep an eye on special characters too, in particular:
° The guys who sold Pokemon at the Casino in exchange for coins;
° The Pokemon vendor in Kelgo's train station;
° People offering internal-game trades;

--------- [Legendary Pokemon Locations]
Q: Where are the legendary Pokemon I'm looking for?
A: In Pokemon Grape there are ELEVEN legendary Pokemon.
 That's quite a lot. Most legendary Pokemon are well hidden,
 hence the quest for finding them is, at least in my opinion,
 more exciting.

However, if you are bugged-off because you cannot find'em
 all then here's a small list:

(xx/05) = Difficulty (01-05)

(05)
*Mewtwo: Safari Zone, Area 5 (a.k.a. "Restricted Area").
 There's a puzzle to solve in order to acces that area and
 it involves boulders and counted steps.
 Measure your player's steps carefully, and think first
 before you move. As an added bonus, you will unlock the
 "New Safari Trick" upon his capture!
 (Find it out by yourself, it's way too cool);

(02)
*Mew: Port, below the truck at the pier.
 Well, that's a legend becoming true, because according to
 old Pokemon Red rumours you could find Mew by moving the
 hidden truck at the SS.Anne's Harbour using Strength.
 Here the same thing happens but for real this time.
 That has been defined "the Holy Grail of Pokemon Hacking";

(03)
*Zapdos: Power Plant, located on Route 70.
 Exit Lauras Cave from its southern exit (the one past
 the boulder on bottom-right of the map), then
 proceed eastward of Lauras City by cutting the
 small tree and follow the adjacent route until
 the Power Plant.

(02)
*Articuno: Wizard Peak, Hidden Icy Area.
 First, you have to find the HM06 that contains Dive then
 look out for a dark water spot somewhere in Wizard Peak.
 Follow the underwater cave to find out Articuno's dungeon.

(05)
*Moltres: Turtle Rock, probably the hardest one.
 First, you have to access the Hotspring in Haven City in
 the Region of Kelgo, then you have to solve the puzzle in
 there to unlock Turtle Rock. Once you get in there, you'll
 have to solve a boulder puzzle while defeating many trainers.

(04)
*Lugia: Shipwreck, Underwater, Route 71. Another hard one.
 First, you have to obtain the Thermo Scope after completing
 the Item Trading Sequence, then obtain HM06 Dive and look
 out for a deep water spot in National Tunnel. That will lead
 you to the underwater area in Route 71. Remember, the
 Thermicscope is required, so keep it with you in your bag.

(04)
*Ho-Oh: Mt.Lyre's Top. Another hard one.
 Remember that unaccessible staircase beside that crumbled
 rock on Mt.Lyre? That's the access for the top of the
 mountain. First, get the Thermo Scope, then you have to
 learn the Falcon Punch from a certain Sage, I won't tell
 you how to do it since it's too funny; however, once all
 ingredients are there, return to Mt.Lyre and break that
 weird rock by interacting with it. Find out the rest by yourself.
 PS: If you don't challenge Ho-Oh when you will meet it and
 then you exit the cave, as a punishment Ho-Oh will retreat
 back onto its cloud watching you and it will be unreacheable.
 That's the punition for not interacting with Ho-Oh as you've
 bothered it! Ho-Oh is quite shy, you know.

(05)
*Raikou, Entei, Suicune: Fish Factory.
 Here you will need once again HM06 Dive, however this time
 you are required to solve a little puzzle to awake them.
 Unfortunately, in this version nothing much happens (altough
 you can obtain any legendary at the end of the Second Quest as
 a prize).
 In the next version, however, as soon as you complete this
 event (or, if you have already completed it in this version),
 they will be awakened and they will roam around the region.
 That's right, like in Pokemon Gold\Silver.
 Get yourself a lot of Fast Balls and Pokemon that can easily
 inflict status ailments (Sleep reccomended). There are a couple
 items that will help you in such a task, most notably the very
 useful Scouter, which is almost undispensable. Another helpful
 goodie can be Honey (which doubles encounter rates per area).

(05)
*Driadjin: ???. It might be the hardest one to find by all means.
 This involves a quite secret quest called the "Hidden Quest".
 The Hidden Quest consists of two parts: the "Item Trading Sequence"
 and the "Gem Quest".
 The Gem Quest is required to unlock both the Hidden Palace
 and Crystal Island, a NPC will mention it.
 I can't help you there, it is one of the most funny quests in this
 game and it will require you a lot of time, however it will
 bring to you a lot of excitement and that's guaranteed.
 Driadjin is a very, very... VERY powerful Pokemon
 so the hunt is worthwile.

Keep in mind that if you defeat by accident one of the
 legendaries it is not big tragedy, you can always earn all
 of them at the end of the Second Quest as a reward.
 There's the notable exception of Driadjin which is received in
 any case as a reward of the Hidden Quest -- which is fair
 considering 1) how confusing and long that quest is and
 2) that, unlike newest games, this is the only legendary
 that is received, and it's not found that easily.
Spoiler: there is a couple secrets involving the Dradjin "methods",
 why did I use the plural form...? Who knows, I'm only a ReadMe file!

---------
Q: How do I wake up the legendary dogs? 
A: In the room hosting the three beasts you will find a weird platform.
 Interacting with it will display a clue -- in Braille. Remember
 that once you solve the riddle you need to interact with that very same
 pad to trigger the sequence. Apparently, the whole setting doesn't
 seem to suggest players what to do so I included this in the FAQ.

---------
Q: How do Roaming Mechanics work in this game? And what about the Scouter?
A: Once you've awakened the three Legendary Dogs they will start to roam
 around Frejo -- except for the Southern part which is divided by water.
 Since the 3 dogs do not roam on Water -- they appear only on tall grass --
 it was quite useless to have them roaming on those 5 southern routes mostly
 divided by dungeons and large gaps. Thanks to the Region's unique geometry
 you can hunt them somehow easier than, let's say, Hoenn.

The three Beasts, once spawned, do not appear on PokeDex, as it's unfit to
 track them down. Instead, a specialized tool comes in use: the Scouter.
 The Scouter, if held in the player's bag, automatically beeps if there's a
 roaming Pokemon once you enter an area, so make sure you're playing at least
 with headphones rather than with muted audio. Also, upon usage, the Scouter
 can tell you if a Roaming Pokemon is in your area and it can even identify it.
 Keep in mind that the probability of finding one of the beasts is around 65-66%
 (yes, it is that high, I didn't want to frustrate players more than necessary).

---------
Q: Why isn't my Phantump evolving with TradeStone? Is it a glitch?
A: Did you check the item Phantump holds? Back in the days of the kindergarten,
 I sometimes had the misfortune of receiving a Pokemon that held an Everstone...

---------
Q: How many quests are in the game?
A: From Final 1.6 onwards you can see the number of Quests you have completed
 in your Trainer Card: the completion of a quest adds a star in your trainer
 card, much like in the latest Pokemon games. Keeping that in mind, the
 quests featured in this game are:

1) First Quest:		Defeat the Pokemon League (Elite4 + Champion).
2) Second Quest:	Post-League Quest, defeat Kifflom in the Dungeon of Defrite
3) Hidden Quest:	Item Trading Sequence + Gem Quest; obtain Driadjin.
4) PokeDex Quest:	Complete the PokeDex (248 Pokemon species).

The first Quest is the most obvious one: getting all the
 badges and defeating the Pokemon League.
 The Second Quest is the post-league Quest and it involves
 the Dungeon of Defrite and Kifflom, it is reminiscent of
 the planned Silph/League mega-dungeon that was planned
 (and scrapped) during the development of the betas of
 the original japanese versions of Red/Green.

The Hidden Quest is... Well, hidden, as its name implies.
 The unique thing about it is that it is intertwined between
 the First and the Second quest, that is, you can start it
 during the First but you'll end up finishing it not before
 you have beaten the Pokemon League, and you'll have to access
 at least a part of the Second Quest before finishing it.
 Actually the Hidden Quest is divided into two and each half
 of it can give access to VERY rewarding prizes.

---------
Q: Which Quest gives which reward?
A: The Hidden Quest is divided in two: the Item Trading Sequence and
 the Gem Quest. Each one of them holds its reward(s).

* First Quest -- 8 Badges and Pokemon League. That's the very plain
 main story Players are very used to. It unlocks the Second Quest.
* Second Quest -- Post-League. You will enter the Dungeon of Defrite
 and eventually face "Kifflom", the most fearsome trainer ever.
 Rewards: Crystal Island Surface - in there you can catch every
 missable legendary Pokemon in the game and you can buy every TM in
 the game from the "Secret TM Vendors". You also get a few useful items
 during the way, like the Magic Hammer, Scouter, Dog Bait, and Shinizer.
* Item Trading Sequence -- It can be fully done even before you complete
 the First Quest. Rewards: Lugia & Ho-Oh obtainable; Unlock Gem Quest.
* Gem Quest -- You have to find 6 colored Gems and to collect
 the Master Gem from the Hidden Palace. Get all the Chaos Emer... Huh,
 Power Gems and you will unlock the secret Crystal Island Dungeon.
 Unfortunately, getting to those locations is quite a secret unless you're
 smart enough to solve this chaotic, cryptic puzle.
 Rewards: Dradjin (yep, that is VERY rewarding!).

---------
Q: What about Haircuts and the Barber NPC?
A: From Final Version 1.5 onwards you can access Haven Forest and
 eventually meet a hidden NPC who, for a small fee, can do a haircut/
 shaving/beauty treatment to one of your Pokemon. He is hidden, tough.

By doing this, you can evolve a few Pokemon species that canonically
 evolve only when their Happyness Rate is high (200 or so), this means
 that this guy is capable of evolving Chansey into Blissey and Golbat
 into Crobat -- in previous versions you had to level up them to high
 levels, something that was quite boring and frustrating.

Also, you can evolve Eevee into Espeon or Umbreon if the Clock is enabled
 (thanks to a couple NPCs in the same map); the evolution into one or the
 other depends on the part of day (daylight for Espeon or night time for
 Umbreon). In previous versions, you couldn't obtain Espeon or Umbreon
 through evolution but only by winning them at the Casino or either choosing
 one as a prize from Flannery's Gym in Quartz Town.

This is mostly based off the Haircut brothers in the Goldenrod Basements
 from Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal, with the exception that, since there's
 no Happyness System in Pokemon Grape, this has no other effect past the
 special evolution method it provides.

---------
Q: I'm looking for special NPCSs with special functions! Where are them?
A: Here are the locations for all of them:
 * Name Rater: Buris City. Rename your Pokemon; 
 * DayCare: Gondwan City. Raise one of your Pokemon for money;
 * Move Deleter: Haven City (Kelgo). He can delete moves, even HM techniques;
 * Move Tutor: Hardat City (Kelgo). He can teach any move from a Pokemon's moveset;
 * Hot Spring Lady: Haven City (Kelgo), P.C.C. She lets you access the HotSpring;
 * Item Diviner: Buris City, Hotel California. Guesses the last used item;
 * Pokemon Smeller: Hardat City (Kelgo). Can guess the last encountered Pokemon;
 * Soul Reader: Route 66 Gate F2. Can read your Pokemon's DVs;
 * Barber: Haven Forest (Kelgo), hidden. Can evolve a few Pokemon species;

 ° Note: The Move Tutor, Pokemon Smeller, Soul Reader, and Barber can be found only
 from Final 1.5 onwards.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First Quest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
---------
Q: Help, I'm stuck in the first town!
A: Before you explore Mt.Lyre you may want to level up your Pokemon
 on Route 51. You can access that tall grass spot by walking near
 Bek's Lab, heading northwards and then descending to the left of the
 mountain's ledge by the "rocky steps" to the side of the rock.
 In the meanwhile, you may visit the PokeCenter in Rustel City and
 buy a new Pokemon for 500 PokeMoney for further advantage.

Next, you may challenge a few trainers in Mt.Lyre as far as you can
 go, because there's something that prevents your from going further
 unless you received your PokeDex from Prof.Bek.
 In order to do that, deliever the Parcel at the Mart in Rustel City
 to Prof.Bek, then get back to Paceleaf City and head westward to
 Route 61.
 Here you will meet Paul, defeat him so you can enter his villa.

Once you're inside Paul's Villa, look for a room containing an item
 under the form of a PokeBall, take it and you will receive the item
 that will allow you to exit Mt.Lyre.
 Wasn't this early adventure quest more exciting than the ususal ones?

---------
Q: Why is the player not jumping past slopes? Is it a bug?
A: Nope, I added a measure to avoid unwanted jumps by players.
 Since the great amount of one-way jumps in this game, and since I
 received many complaints due to players jumping unwillingfully while
 playing in fast-forward mode, I decided to introduce the "Jump Button".

In a few words: you can only jump past slopes while running, that is,
 while pressing and holding the "B Button" (on Gameboy) while facing
 and moving toward the slope. This also applies to the newly introduced
 north-facing slopes and certain jumping gaps.

---------
Q: How do I jump past the gaps in Mt.Lyre?
A: While moving keep the Gameboy's equivalent of the "B Button" pressed
 and then, while facing the gap, move the directional pad in the gap's
 direction: the player will jump past. This also applies for jumps
 between ladders in sidescrolling areas.

---------
Q: How do I make money more easily, even in the post-game?
A: Leaving aside the usual methods (Elite4, fights, item selling etc.),
 here are the newly introduced methods:

* Girlfriend's lend: Your girlfriend Keira, who lives next door to you in
 Paceleaf City, is a (covert) billionaire, and she will happily supply you
 3000 Rupees in case you are short of funds or even without money.
 Furthermore, she will give you a Pokemon for free (a Meowth) in case you
 remain with only one Pokemon with you once you began your adventure
 (Meowth learns plenty of HM moves, too).
This feature allows you to always remain with cash at the start of your
 adventure. The amount provided also allows you to hire the bounty killer (!)
 later in the game to proceed, since his fee matches exactly the amount
 Keira gives to you. Since this game was reputed to be too hard, especially
 at the beginning, I added a few exploits to aid players a bit.

* Mining: with an investment in mining picks you can try your luck at
 mining in caves. You can find valuable items by mining: elementar stones,
 rare prized items (nuggets, pearls, etc.)... Or even low-selling junk.
 Furthermore, you can eventually find a hidden Rock Drill very late in the
 First Quest that has the same function but with unlimited uses.
 Once you manage to retrieve it, there is a very low chance that you run
 out of funds, on the contrary, you will find it hard to empty your wallet.

* Thief: The Thief move effect was introduced in Final 1.5 and it is fully
 operational from Final 1.6 onwards. Many Pokemon may hold valuable items
 (e.g: Nugget, Big Mushroom, etc.), so players can steal their held items by
 using the move Thief (which is also a TM move, so it can be purchased and
 taught to almost any Pokemon), provided that the thieving Pokemon does not
 hold any item. This also applies to the Pokemon sent in battle, so you can
 eventually steal from Trainers' Pokemon, too (with the notable exceptions
 of Link Battles in the Colosseum, and perhaps in the Battle Tower if it will
 be ever implemented).

---------
Q: Where do I find the Town Map?
A: Cherry City, in one of the houses south of the Pokemon Center.
 Talk to the woman dressed in white in there who is called Peach
 (Note: She's not the omonymous character from the Super Mario games).

---------
Q: I cannot buy all the special PokeBalls! Why?
A: Many special PokeBalls can be bought at the newly added PokeBall Factory
 mini-dungeon from an NPC. Also, upon completing a couple requests by the
 Regina character (you have to unlock the pathway to her first) she will
 give permission to some hidden vendors to sell you some of her goodies!

---------
Q: The first cave dungeon is annoying\unforgiving!
A: You can grind your Pokemon team in Route 51 after receiving
 your starter from Prof.Bek, just head north from his lab then
 look for some rock spots toward the left side of the ledge north
 of the lab. Go down there, follow the route and you will find
 some tall grass.

Alternatively, you can grind in the first two areas of Mt.Lyre.
 Keep in mind that a few trainers can be skipped (the vulgar
 hiker and the grass-type Lass for instance) just in case you
 find it too unforgiving. Keep in mind that I've put an
 emergency exit halfway in the dungeon and a PokeCenter shortly
 after the cave exit, on Route 52. 

---------
Q: I'm stuck between the three "Rage Sisters"!
A: Just head northward by one step entering the building in
 the process. Exit the building again and the sisters
 will be back into their places, allowing you to go past.
 Triple Encounters are normally impossible in
 regular Pokemon Games, however, Pokemon Grape is quite
 renown for such impossible things.

---------
Q: I cannot beat this trainer\Gymleader\rival!
A: You can buy Rare Candies, either by exchanging them for
 coins at the Casino (hard way) or buying them from the
 Wiccas at the Pharmacy in Route 54 (expensive easy way).
 Alternatively, there are a few good grinding areas where
 you can find some Pokemon whose type might be exactly what
 you were looking for. Keep also an eye on people who want to
 trade their Pokemon. Some are just what you need (eg: Seedot
 before the 2nd Gym, etc.).

---------
Q: How do I go to Kelgo?
A: There are 3 ways of travelling between Regions:

*1) Via land thru the Regional Tunnel (Hard Way);
 Go to Gondwan City and surf southwards the large lake found there
 to go to Route 69, in there you will find National Tunnel.
 It happens that National Tunnel also hosts the entrance to the
 Pokemon League since a common entrance for both regions is needed
 as the Border Zone is apparently crowded by soldiers.

*2) Via Magnet Train (Easy Way);
 You need a Train Pass (get one from the Weapon Depot's President)
 to access the train wagon, once you do you can easily travel
 between Silten City (Frejo) and Haven City (Kelgo).
 Enter the train wagon and select your destination from the special panel.

*3) Via Fast Ship (Alternative Easy Way);
 Once you reach Hardat City in Kelgo you can easily travel between the
 two Regions via Fast Ship, provided that you bring with you the SS.Ticket.
 Enter the ship and look for an empty cabin upstairs, once in there check
 out the bed. In this bed, from Final Version 1.5, you can rest and heal
 your Pokemon party, however if you visited Hardat at least once you can rest
 there and let the ship depart to the other region.
 ° Note: To access to this functionality, you have to heal at the Hardat City's
 Pokemon Center at least once, so that the City can be "flagged" as visited.

---------
Q: How do I pass past the guards in the Route gates around Silten City?
A: Bribe them with a regular drink (Fresh Water, PokeCola, Lemonade)
 like in the original Pokemon Red/Blue. Apparently, newer players are
 more familiar with the FireRed/LeafGreen remakes where, instead of
 these, you trade them with a cup of tea, and so end up in confusion.
 You can find these either atop the Cherry Mart's Roof or on the Second
 Floor of the Gondwan Mart.

---------
Q: Help! A Team Rocket guy is blocking the access of the Weapon Depot!
 How do I enter there now?
A: This is the "Bounty Killer Sidequest", which was implemented from Final 1.5 onwards.
 Now in front of the Weapon Depot (in newly started savegames OR started savegames
 before saving Mr.Abe in Spooky Swamp) there is this guy blocking your
 path who mentions how he's not afraid of the Bounty Killer in Hardat City.
 This means that you have precisely to find him to get rid of that Rocket.

First, go to Gondwan City and go southwards, swimming past the lake found south
 of that City to reach Route 69 and the Regional Tunnel. Enter there and
 reach Haven City, in the Region of Kelgo. You can explore that City a bit and
 get involved in a couple sidequests, however, when you're done go to the newly
 opened house west of the City (the one just north of Leon's House) that acts also
 as a route gate, exit from the doorway to the north to enter Route 76.

In Route 76 you will soon find an access to a completely new Dungeon, Haven Forest.
 In Haven Forest you will encounter a few sages that will let you pass only if
 you defeated all the trainers found in 4 locations -- the previously optional
 "minor dungeons": PokeBall Factory, Fast Ship, Fish Factory and Turtle Rock.
 This means that, once you have got the HM03 for Surf, you will require to backtrack
 to those places (if you have not visited them before) and defeat all trainers
 found there.

Beware: now you will also need HM06 (Dive) to reach one of those trainers, precisely
 in the Fish Factory (in the same area where the Legendary Dogs are located).
 Also, in order to access Turtle Rock you need to enter the Hotspring in Haven City
 (the second woman in the counter nearby the Nurse Joy in the Pokemon Communication
 Center) and solve a riddle there to unlock Turtle Rock. In order to solve it, you
 will have to carry with you 2 latest-evoluted forms of 2 Kanto starters, which can
 be bought from the Starter Vendor in the Haven City Train Station, and be able to
 read the hidden text on the "Rock wall" found in the Hot Spring (the rocky surface
 beside the northern unaccessible pool with the waterfall going in) -- it is a puzzle.
 Don't worry about being stuck: one of the sage provides a good amount of money in
 case you don't have enough so you can buy the Starters.

Once you go past Haven Forest you will be able to reach Hardat City. Explore the City
 and you will find the Bounty Killer somewhere. Don't worry about getting stuck there
 either, remember that your girlfriend in Paceleaf can give you some money if you're
 short on funds. The most you know this game, the easiest it gets ;)

---------
Q: One of the sages in Haven Forest still blocks me. Am I missing someone?
A: Yes, there's a 99% chance you've missed the (from Final 1.5 onwards) hidden Gruntette/
 CoolTrainerF in the Fish Factory. She is now located past the area where Dive is
 needed (just before the 3 dogs). Apparently she is also responsable for both the
 accident at the Fish Factory and the 3 dogs being inebriated (from radiation sickness).

---------
Q: Why is my first Party Pokemon freezing and then sleeping when I enter
 the balcony found in the Weapon Depot? Is it a bug? How do I avoid it?
A: No, it's an intended feature for an additional hazard previously never
 seen. As the NPCs in there mention, at that height there are cold winds
 that freeze your hands. Since the Pokemon inside the ball is warmer than
 your hand, as a consequence of thermodynamics, it will transfer its body
 heat to your hand, leaving him frozen. However, since I found this to be
 too unfair to new players, I tricked the game into giving it a Sleep status
 too so, upon the second turn, the Pokemon will turn to sleep status and
 supposedly wake up later.
 As the NPCs in the area mention, the only way to avoid this is by carring
 the Grip Gloves with you so that those prevent your hands from freezing.

---------
Q: Wait, I cannot even access Route 73 and the Pokemon League!
A: The Pokemon League border access located on Route 72 can now
 only be accessed through a hidden path where Dive is needed.

First, earn the first Six badges so you can use all HM moves up
 to Surf and Dive, then go to Gondwan City (the green one) and
 surf southward from there to reach Route 69. Enter the Regional
 Tunnel there and look for a water pond with a dark water spot.
 It's the one nearby the "League Access Underwater" sign.
 (Note: before Final 1.6, this sign reads: "No sleep 'till Brooklyn").
 Alternatively you can reach that area from Kelgo if you arrived
 there via the Magnet Train.

In any case, dive down there and follow the underwater route
 until, at the end of the north-western portion of the area, you'll
 find the light spot where you'll emerge in Route 72, on the path
 leading to the League Access. Even if you don't have all the
 badges you can still go there to visit Route 73, catch/battle
 against powerful wild Pokemon and visit an interesting house.

 ° Note: From Final 1.6 onwards, a shortcut between Route 72 and Route 73
 will be unlocked once you have shown the Acid Badge to the first guard located
 on the nearby route gate at least once. This makes the trip way easier than
 in the previous versions, and allows way faster travel and backtracking.

---------
Q: I have all the badges but I cannot enter the Panopticon yet...?
A: Yes, as first you need to solve a small part of storyline.
 When you got all the badges you should meet Paul for some story-
 related thing and battle him. Once you win you can access the
 Panopticon.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Second Quest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
---------
Q: OMG! "Kifflom" is unbeatable! How do I beat him?
A: There are multiple ways of defeating Kifflom.
 The methods here are in order from the easiest one to the hardest one:

*1) FIND DRIADJIN:
 By finding Driadjin Kifflom will be less menacing.
 Driadjin is a very powerful PokeGod so you should have no problems in pulverizing Kifflom.
*2) FIND WALLY:
 That sounds idiotic, but it's true: if you find a certain NPC called Wally he will
 unlock something very special for you, and it will ultimately lead to a way of
 defeating Kifflom. If you combine Method 1 with this method, you will be unstoppable;
*3) SNAG OFF ONE OF HIS POKEMON:
 At a certain point in your adventure, you will get in possess of the Snag Ball,
 a rare item that allows the player to steal a trainer's Pokemon.
 By stealing a Pokemon the battle ends prematurely, and this would be a smart tactic
 if used against an almost unbeatable trainer like Kifflom.
 It won't be an easy task to accomplish, tough: furthermore, there's the risk of losing
 the precious item permanently if the capture fails. Good luck!
*4) KIFFLOM GOT BOMBED, LOL!: Featured since Final 1.6.
 This one sounds even more stupid. If you manage to bomb Kifflom he will be easier to defeat.
 Remember, you only have one chance to bomb him since the Bomb is gone after use.
*5) FIGHT HIM LIKE A MAN:
 The hardest one. No cheats, no shortcuts, just a brutal fight with the most powerful nemesis
 ever in Pokemon history.  Type combination is the only thing that will help you.
 Good luck.

---------
Q: Is that one really Kifflom?
A: Yes, he is.

---------
Q: But I've seen a video in which Kifflom uses a different team! Why?
A: Since Final 1.6 Kifflom uses a different team depending on which Starter you
 have chosen at the beginning of the game. This effectively resurrects the unused
 concept of a fight against (no spoiler) a certain character, a concept that was
 effectively scrapped from the Pokemon Red/Green development stage and which left
 a few traces even in the final game. Since no one ever thought of that, I did :P

---------
Q: What is the empty house in Plateau Zone meant for?
A: That is a secret shortcut for Dungeon of Defrite once you defeat Kifflom,
 you can greatly facilitate navigation to that area so you can collect
 forgotten treasures you eventually left out, catch very strong Pokemon, have
 the Plateau PokeCenter at very close reach and travel between these areas
 whenever you want.

---------
Q: Is there a faster way of getting to the Dungeon of Defrite?
A: Yes, once you defeat Kifflom and get the Card Key you can unlock the gate
 found in Paul's Villa (a.k.a. Pacesea Villa) and return to the "evil" Subway.
 Upon defeating Kifflom you can also travel between Plateau Zone and the
 Dungeon, so that you can visit Crystal Island any time you wish.

---------
Q: How do I find Crystal Island? And what kind of rewards are there?
A: Crystal Island is the main reward for the completion of the Second Quest.
 In this Island you can basically catch all the legendary Pokemon found during the
 game, as many times as you wish. This means that if you defeated one by accident
 you can still complete your PokeDex by coming there. Furthermore, you can build
 up experience easily here, so you can eventually train your Pokemon Team(s).

Also, as an additional award, in there you can find the "Secret TM Vendors".
 These are a group of "Talking Tombs" who behave exactly like vendors: from these
 you can buy all the TMs found in the game. This is especially useful considering
 that, unlike in newer core series games, TMs here have limited use (and no, I do
 not have plans to update the TM system: item storage is very limited, and I also
 want to keep the original difficulty and thrill of using TMs wisely.
 Nonetheless, this special award largely supplies for the "infinite TMs").

---------
Q: What does this mean for the Post-game? Is it of any use?
A: Yes, it is supposed to: by combining the Move Tutor, Crystal Island, the
 Dungeon of Defrite, the Secret TM Vendors, secret items like the Rock Drill
 and the PokeBall Factory, de facto you access to a powerhouse of customizable
 opportunities and unlimited choice in creating, assembling, and customizing
 your Pokemon Teams. If you add to the equation the Wicca Pharmacy (that is,
 vitamins, and eventually Rare Candies) you get an unlimited potential in
 Pokemon customization, something that was perhaps unprecedented in other
 Pokemon hacks (and perhaps even in many of the original games).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hidden Quest(s)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
---------
Q: Help! I do not know how to start the Item Trading Sequence!
A: The Item Trading Sequence, which is a big part of the Hidden Quest,
 both starts and ends in Haven City, Kelgo. By talking with a
 series of characters you'll end up discovering a gambler -- at the
 Pokemon Communication Center -- who is in bad need of a certain
 quite common item. Hand him one of these and he will give you
 a special item. This item, in turn, is sought by another
 character who will give you in turn another item, etc. until
 you'll receive a secret item needed to advance to the second
 part of the Hidden Quest, the "Gem Quest". The hardest part
 of the Item Trading Sequence is figuring out which character
 comes next, and many exchanges aren't that obvious as many
 require you to talk to every character and remember a few
 details in their dialogue that might give you a clue about
 who needs what.

---------
Q: What is the "New Safari Trick"? How do I unlock it?
A: The "New Safari Trick" is a novelty addition that allows you to
 visit the Safari Zone without paying and without the Safari Mode active.
 This means that, thanks to this feature, you can visit the Safari Zone
 freely, without worrying about steps and about Safari Balls as you can
 visit it like any other regular area in the game.
 This is reversible: should you decide it is better the old Safari Game
 you can take the regular entrance and activate the event as usual through
 the Entrance counter/admission fee etc. as usual.

Since players were confused about how to unlock this feature and about
 how it works (previously, it was kept as a secret not to spoil the
 surprises added in this game) here's how to unlock it:
 Once you caught/defeated Mewtwo in the last secret area of the Safari
 Zone you will unlock a new flight location to the Safari Zone! You can
 Fly there anytime, bypassing the Safari Game admission. And if you exit
 the area through the entrance and then saying "No" to the warden in there
 you can just exit normally without any side effect at all (even if you
 saved and restarted the game in the Safari Zone -- even under Safari Mode)
 since, thanks to bug fixing, the warden always resets the Safari function
 upon exiting from there.

---------
Q: Whaaaat!? Is there the Find-Wally-Thing!? For real?
A: Yes! :D It's another secret among many buried in this
 cryptic game. I cannot help you there, I can only say that
 indeed he exists somewhere and that upon finding him he
 will unlock for you a very secret thing... Hint: I gave
 some kind of cryptic visual clues on the ground, somewhere...

---------
Q: I'm confused about which area is Crystal Island, what do you mean?
A: Crystal Island appears as that whirlpool on Frejo's Town Map. It is
 divided into two parts: the Outside Area which is referred as Crystal Island,
 and the Underground Area which hosts the Grape Lodge which contains Dradjin.
 Both areas are at times referred by me as "Crystal Island" since during
 development those two areas were interconnected and upon completing both the
 Hidden Quest and the Second Quest a ladder would appear on the surface,
 connecting it with the undergound where now sits the secret entrance to the
 Hall of Fame as an Alternate Ending. Since there was no real interest for such
 a useless feature for a 100% completed game I left it out.

~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
               Other Questions
~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
---------
Q: Why does the grammar suck at times?
A: Unfortunately, I had the bad luck of being born in a
 quite disfunctional country where English isn't the mother tongue.
 Ordinary education (when it's accessible) sucks badly compared
 to way more organized countries in the same continent (see:
 Scandinavia). This means that I had to learn this language by
 myself, by trial and error, in the course of many years.

Alas, since the development of this game was a quite hard and long work,
 sometimes I commited many stupid grammar mistakes here and there due
 to excessive fatigue. I apologize for the occasional Engrish.

---------
Q: Why is the Region called "Frejo"? How do I pronounce it?
A: Frejo and Kelgo are basically a mirrored hodgepodge of Sardinia, Corsica,
 and the coastlines of Southern France and Western Italy.

There's no real "correct" pronunciation, although the popular ones are
 "Fre-Joe" or "Fre-djoe" (a là French); other pronunciations
 ("Fre-Yo" or "Fre-Ho") are mostly regional localizations, because, you see,
 "Europe still has no telephone prefix". Jajajajaja.

---------
Q: Why did it take so long?
A: That's a good one.
 First, manipulating the game byte by byte manually means that the most complex
 scripting has to be assembled directly as a series of hexadecimal numbers rather
 than having everything written and compiled automatically with a utility; this
 slowed down things a little.

Second, I realized this on the village's only running public computer which still
 has bulletholes carved in since the last war. Fortunately, the stuff I'm working
 with is old enough to be compatible with such old hardware.

---------
Q: Give me the Cheat Codes!
A: Cheating with GameShark or GameGenie codes on a game with differently located
 RAM areas is very risky, and most of the times you'll end up corrupting
 your game (or even the savegame) and experiencing halucinogenic glitches of any kind.
 Keep in mind that this game is based off the international Pokemon Red so the most common
 GameShark codes for Pokemon Red _may_ (or may not) work also on this game -- but
 it's not guaranteed so, if you cheat, you do that at your own risk, you've
 been advised.
In any case, reminder: the GameShark overwrites specific RAM areas with a hexadecimal
 value, while the GameGenie overwrites a specific ROM location (loaded in RAM in the
 range of adresses 0x0000-0x7FFF) only and only if its previous value matches the
 one specified in the GameGenie cheat code (potentially to avoid accidental patching).

Nonetheless, cheat codes may be useful for fixing compatibility issues arising
 from upgrading to eventual future versions etc. and in such case I'll include
 a list of codes to employ in those situations.

---------
Q: Sometimes I feel I am seeing weird hidden/subtle comedy double-meanings...
 Were some of the maps and/or teams and choices of the game design intentional?
A: Indeed. Grape not only achieves comedy by textual content but also through
 less obvious visual (and even auditive) components. These were previously tested
 in other games, but here I decided to experiment and push things a bit further.
Map layouts sometimes are ironic -- e.g: Paul's Villa: a TM containing "Gas Bomb"
 placed on the wedding bed of Team Rocket's boss, leather gloves (Grip Gloves)
 placed on the pillow of a bed used (and mentioned) by one of the guards in there, etc.
 Even the NPCs sometime joke about the map layout or about these design aspects.
Oftentimes Pokemon teams are ironic and/or subdolous: notably, the PokeBall Factory,
 the already mentioned Paul's Villa, Cycling Road, etc. The Pokemon party sometimes
 evokes subdolous concepts and/or characterial traits shared by the NPCs that are
 not otherwise mentioned. Non-battling NPCs too share this aspect.
 There are enough packs of trivia and conjectures about this game to fill a library.

             			Annoying Questions
		~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~
---------
Q: Are there all the legendaries in this game?
A: In this game there are not five but *eleven* legendary Pokemon.
 That's quite a lot, even in comparison with the most-sought 16-bits hacks.
 For a 8-bit game like this one, this is a dream coming true.
 Now, the fact that nowadays most fanmade Pokemon games hold something
 like 400 legendaries demonstrates how priority is focused on the
 "Uber-Pokemon" hype rather than on other aspects of the game
 (mapping, scripting, functionalities, story, texts etc.).
 Judge this fact on this report: such legendary-filled hacks 95% of the times
 SUCK BADLY. And most of the times they are very, very unfinished.

---------
Q: Naaaw, I want Primal Deoxys and Delta Xerneas! And Hyper Beasts!
A: Yeeeah, and I wanted Princess Zelda to kiss my back's low-end.
 This is not a mainstream legend-fueled fangame. I put priority on
 other aspects (improvements, addons, graphics, characters etc.).
 It is already a good thing I more than doubled the existing number
 of legendaries and put lots of secrets during the quest.
 Furthermore, they way those are obtained are infinitively better
 than "Secret rOAd tO tHe Kyogre iN Ruby" or similar...
 If you're looking for games made only of legendary pokemons, please
 head over to the "Prematurely Abandoned hacks" section.

---------
Q: aRe tHeRe all tEh RegGgioOooOnZ & 35535 PokImAnz!!?
A: Again, my game is quality over quantity.
 If this message just doesn't stick into your cerebral matter
 (in a few words, your brains), well, yours is a lost cause.
 Go back playing "Pokemon Ultimate Need for Legendaries Pro
 Soccer Underground" or similar if you insist.

---------
Q: But I wanted [your favorite things] like in Pokemon [Version]!
A: I satisfied *a lot* of requests from fans (more than you can ever imagine),
 however, if I were to satisfy every single request then Pokemon Grape
 would not have been any longer my hack but a game designed by the
 first bystanders who would demand _anything_ conceivable by fancy.
 Even then, I'm only one, and I clearly cannot do the amount of job
 an entire team can - completing this was already an inhumane task.
 Enjoy it as it comes, it's still an amazing game for its times.

---------
Q: I want the next update of Grape!
A: Well, at least we agree on this one...

---------
Q: I want you to come to [annoying useless social network] to answer me!
A: After years of scandals and people posting videos\twitters that were authentic 
 insults against human intelligence, I grew afraid of social networks and
 web life in general so I will not show up there anymore. Sorry.

Q: wHeRe dO I fInD tHe eMuLaTeRs?
A: I can't help you. I don't give around emulators.
 It shouldn't be hard to have a search on your favorite browsing
 service on the Internet and look at the emulators by yourself.

---------
Q: wHeRe dO I fInD tHe ROOOOMMMs!?
A: I'd like to make clear one point: I don't give around ROMs. Never.
 I am not even going to consider that idea for an istant.
 So, about the ROMs, find them on the Internet (or on Dark-Web, if you are
 that desperate) by yourself.
 As a side note... Probably nowadays it isn't that simple either.
 Still, that is not of my business as far as I'm concerned.

A: This is an example on how to get cursed on these days' web on record time.

Q: Gimme the .jar! Where is the .jar!?
A: "The .Jar of cookies must be somewhere in the kitchen" (citation).
 As much as I am not going to give ROMs, I'm not going to give .jar files
 around either. I'm not going to repeat that once again, therefore convert
 the .JAR or .PIE or whatever by yourself.

   This section details all the previous Final releases of Pokemon Grape.
It includes a detailed changelog keeping track of bug fixes, addons, and miscellaneous. 
Should a compatibility issue arise from one version to the other, an upgrade procedure
will be provided so that players can successfully upgrade while keeping their savegame.
Since the newer releases had SO many additions, I decided to divide this sections in
sub-chapters for an easier navigation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Which Version am I playing?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The Final Version number (e.g: Final 1.5, 1.6, and so forth) is shown in-game in the
first intro screen below the intro credits upon loading the game.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How do I Update Grape?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   1) Repeat the same procedure you find in the section "How To Play" (Chapter 1) on this
ReadMe, this time with the latest release of Pokemon Grape.
Do not erase your older version yet, follow the following points.
   2) Before carrying over your older Save file (if it's compatible) follow the
"Update Instructions" that are listed in the next section, according to the Final version
you want to play, of course.
   3) While playing your older version of Grape, save your game in a safe indoor area
without major events, for example a PokeMart or Player's Room, in order to avoid accidents
(like getting stuck etc. and so forth). Keep your Save file from the older version.
   4) Carry over your previous Save file by putting it in the folder in which you are
playing Grape, making sure the names of the game and of the save file are matching.
Or, viceversa, put the new Grape version in place of the older one.
   5) Enjoy.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Side Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   1) Keep in mind that any Emulator-generated "Save-State" (which is NOT the same thing as a
Save game) is not supposed to be compatible from version to version, so get rid of those
before messing things up. It's incredible how often such accidents are triggered.

   2) It is very likely that if a glitch\bug\oversight is found in one release
it might be found in the previous releases (a result of a troublesome game development).
However, many of these bugs are unlikely to be found on the older Demos, because most of the
radical game changes took place between Demo3.1 and Final 1.0.
On the contrary, A LOT of glitches\bugs\oversights found in the demos are no longer there
on the Final Versions (and that's very good).

   3) At last, I remind a last time that the old Demos aren't compatible with the Finals.
Obviously, neither the Save game nor the older Save-states (alas) are compatible.
Just in case, however this seems to be an odd yet constant occurrence among old-time players.
Nostalgia generates monsters (or glitches, in this case), y'know.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Final 1.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Release Date:			Christmas 2021
* Backward Compatible:		Yes
* Short Description:		Major Update. Fixes + new important additions.

   This release features the newly added Held Item mechanics, as in the newest games.
As a consequence, it also features the newly introduced Evolution through Held Item.
Furthermore, the Everstone this time is fully functional, as promised.
Working with the messy R/B/Y engine, this feature had to be coded from scratch, thus
it took quite a (long) while to make it feasible for the Pokemon Red engine.
Nonetheless, after having been stated in the game way back since Demo3, these
features are finally here for the whole world to play.
   This version also fixes the annoying bugs that plagued Final 1.5 -- most notably,
Tyrogue evos, Snagged Pokemon sent in the PC losing moves, Move Tutor quirks, Mining, etc.
And, lastly, the whole game has been de-capitalized, giving it a more modern feeling.
This means that starting the game anew almost gives a totally different experience. Enjoy.

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			 -- Update Instructions --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Note 0: When "upgrading" and carrying your older savefile, save your game in a PokeCenter
 or in the Player's Room in your older version. A few maps were changed, and there's the
 (eventual) risk of remaining stuck somewhere or screwing something up.
 Do not save your game in the following maps before "upgrading":
 Buris City, Casino, Route 60, Wizard Peak's Wormhole Cave, Route 66, Haven Forest,
 Dungeon of Defrite (Kifflom Area).

# Note 1: A few Items will be "transformed" in this Update, so it would be wise to
 sell/toss/exchange any of the following Items you have in your bag and PC Item Storage
 before applying the update, in particular the exchangeable key items, like the
 Kart Voucher and the 3 Relics.
 Therefore, get rid of the following items:
	° Great Ball 			---> 	Bright Powder
	° Kart Voucher 			--->	Sitrus Berry
	° Aqua Relic			--->	(dummied out)
	° Gold Relic			--->	(dummied out)
	° White Relic			--->	Leftovers
	° Shinizer (now "Shiny Repel")	--->	Lum Berry

# Note 2: Before updating to Final 1.6 make sure to reset the clock in Haven Forest
 (talk to the sage that resets/shuts off the clock).

# Note 3: Story-related only for those ones who still have to complete the First Quest.
 If you've already obtained both the Train Pass and the Grip Shoes you can skip this paragraph.

Now Elza/Leon in Haven City (Kelgo) gives you the Train Pass as a reward, and the
 President at the top of the Weapon Depot (Silten City, Frejo) gives you the Grip Shoes
 after defeating Team Rocket and Steelhan. In order to avoid discrepancies in your
 adventure in progress, either update BEFORE getting HM03/Surf (better) or alternatively
 AFTER you have received BOTH the Grip Shoes and the Train Pass after completing the
 related events. Considering the events and the layout, it is not much of a drastic change;
 however, this adjustement is considerably helpful since new players can now travel between
 Frejo and Kelgo way faster before getting access to the Weapon Depot (after helping Leon/Elza).
There is a catch, however: you can board the train in Haven City _only_ if you got access
 to Silten City first, that is, if you have already bribed the guards in the Silten Route
 gate with one of the three drinks, otherwise an interphone in the Haven Train Station will
 advise that the service is temporarily unavailable. This arrangement prevents players
 from getting stuck outside Silten City pushed out by the guards, and it prevents too
 much sequence-skipping (for example, skipping the access to Silten either via Route 55/
 Fish Factory or via Route 67 & Route 68).
 And it adds realism, too: since Frejo is a hodgepodge of Corsica, Sardinia, Southern France,
 and North-Western Italy, this event echoes more the infamous mass strikes affecting train
 transportation that took place around 1999-2000 (the years in which this game is set)
 precisely in that border area. Previously it was only hinted at, but now it is possibly
 more explicitly referenced.

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
				-- Fixes --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Included the fix for the "PokeDoll Oversight" glitch left by GameFreak developers.
+ Fixed all the glitches involving Tyrogue's evolution:
 ° Tyrogue's evolution no longer triggers the "glitch dimension" if evolved either via
 Rare Candy or via Exp points after battle, and it no longer attempts to evolve multiple times.
 ° Tyrogue's evolution into Hitmontop no longer crashes the game if its evolution is blocked
 and then its evolution is attempted another time via either method of levelling up
 (Level Up after battle or Rare Candies).
 ° Tyrogue's evolution into Hitmonlee (Atk > Def) and Hitmonchan (Def > Atk) are no longer swapped.
 ° Tyrogue now evolves into its own intended form (Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, or Hitmontop).
+ Fixed all the bugs involving the Move Tutor:
 ° Fixed the Move Tutor's range of available moves, now Pokemon can learn their moves up to
  their current level as it was originally meant.
 ° Now the Move Tutor can also teach the moves Pokemon know at level 1.
 ° Fixed the "creepy menu" bug that occasionally showed up with the Move Tutor.
+ Fixed a (not previously noticed, apparently) oversight with Evolution Items that triggered the
 evolution of Pokemon that evolved through Place-evolution and Move-evolution (except Sylveon),
 regardless of the fact that the stone/item was effective or not on that Pokemon.
 This weird behavior was caused by the "stock" game engine itself: it cannot possibly handle newly
 added evolution since using an evolutionary stone tests for/triggers evolution anyway and,
 if the conditions of each newly added evolution matches, the pokemon is effectively evolved,
 regardless if a stone was used or not. Now this oversight has been fixed.
+ Fixed the bug involving the case in which snagged Pokemon in battle do not inherit any move
 if these are immediately sent to the PC after battle because of the full pokemon party.
 (This flaw was caused by the engine of the original Pokemon R/B/Y, which does not account for
 re-calculating the right moves to be assigned to an opponent Pokemon caught in trainer battles).
 As a bonus added, any special move that the snagged opponent Pokemon had will be retained.
+ Fixed the bugs involving wrong calculations with type combinations, damage, and effectiveness.
 ° No more "Hyper-Effective" types (wrong hexadecimal conversion, I must have been tired).
 ° Fixed those repeated type effectiveness multipliers that accounted for a few flawed effects.
 ° Wood type is now not very effective (x0.5) against Ice rather than super-effective.
 (The "stock" bug of dual-type message quirks is still there, tough: this will be revised for
 the revision and overhaul of the Battling system, which will take a very long while).
+ Fixed all the glitches involving the Mining Pick and mineral extraction failure.
+ Fixed those glitches involving sleeping, the sleeping system has been reversed to
 its original implementation, although sleep doesn't last anymore a maximum of 7 turns but 3.
+ Fixed and improved Prof.Bek's PokeDex ratings, in particular that one for the completed PokeDex.
 Therefore, the game won't glitch up anymore if you defeat the Pokemon League if the Pokedex is
 complete -- or if you have your PokeDex rated via Bek's PC.
+ Fixed a sequence skipping involving getting earlier to Buris City with Salamence/Fly.
 ° The Wormhole Cave now leads to Route 60 (the "Flight House") as it was originally intended.
+ Wild Pokemon in Dungeon of Defrite External no longer spawn outside of tall grass.
+ Wild Pokemon no longer spawn upon walking on a carpet in Haven City and Silten City.
+ The Rage Sisters' fight on Route 67 no longer triggers the "Mew Glitch".
 You can still perform a few tricks tough (e.g: skipping the third fight, and/or fighting the
 sisters individually so that you can heal back in Route 65). These tricks are popular among
 speedrunners so I chose to leave those two options open; fortunately, you won't trigger
 glitches by performing these tricks anymore.
+ The water in Lauras Cave no longer has a chance of triggering unusual fights and MissingNo.
+ Swift and Feint Attack cannot hit any longer a Pokemon during the invulnerable state of Fly,
 Dig, Dive, and Bounce. Therefore, no weird re-spawning upon hitting Digging Pokemon.
+ In the 8th Gym in Lauras City trainers no longer walk through walls.
+ The trainers on Route 68 have been moved so that they cannot any longer close completely
 the access to Silten City by walking up to the player: there was a (remote) possibility
 of remaining stuck in that portion of the Route without Surf.
+ Torkoal's moveset has been corrected.
+ The Cottage cannot be used in Waspia's and Dante's Gyms anymore, and it cannot be used
  anymore in Uri Tunnel and in the Dungeon of Defrite Sidescrolls (man-made dungeons).
+ PP Up no longer glitches the screen for a split second upon usage.
+ The last ditched TM move compatibilities have been fixed (Porygon learns Psychic,
 Eevee, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon learn Shadow Ball, Magneton learns Tri-Attack).
+ The Credits' song was altered, and now it ends properly at the end of the credits.
+ Roaming Pokemon will also roam on Route71 (rather than Route72) as intended.
+ Snorkel City's "Marill" was replaced with a Rhydon, and its cry is now the correct one.
+ Fixed and added the text for the binoculars in Route 66 Gate (Upstairs).
+ The signsposts/statues in Flannery's Gym were fixed.
+ Fixed the text overlaps in the Ghost/Steuben's (extremely long) dialogue in Spooky Swamp.
+ If you keep pressed either the A or B Button while saving the menu will now disappear.
+ Five-digit experience gain is no longer printed incorrectly.
+ The "odd ball" can now be found in the trash in the Fast Ship's Kitchen.
+ Now you can find the hidden Coins around the Casino. Fixed also that quirk inherited from
 R/B/Y in which 40 Coins were not ever given (the game wrongly gave 20 coins instead).
+ You can now inspect the stuff exposed in the Mart, various bookshelves around, etc.
+ Fixed all of those horrible grammar issues with the word "Strength" (ReadMe included).

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
				-- Add-Ons --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Added the Held Item functionality (!), as in the newer Pokemon games.
+ Items can be given/taken/substituted either from the Pokemon Party menu or from the Bag.
+ Added the Evolution through Held Item mechanic. Now certain Pokemon species evolve only
 if they hold the proper Item while they are levelled up (refer to the appropriate section
 of this ReadMe for further details).
+ Everstone: as already stated in the game, the Pokemon that holds it will not evolve.
 This is particularly helpful for training Tyrogue, Eevee, and other Pokemon too.
+ The Player's Pack was substantially improved and overhauled:
 ° The bag viewed from the Start Menu now features new graphics.
 ° You can see the amount of "pockets" occupied by Items in your bag, so that players
   can know in advance if the bag is full of items and how much space is left.
 ° Item descriptions pop up once you have selected an Item.
 ° A picture of the Item you have selected will now pop up once you have selected that item. 
 ° You have now a "Give" option when you select an Item, and also a "Quit" function.
+ Yes, the move Thief is effectively capable of stealing the attacked Pokemon's held Item.
+ Added the infamous "Kifflom Bombing" event in the 2nd Quest: if you have the Bomb in
 your bag you are asked in your Final Fight against Pr... ehrm, Kifflom if you want to
 toss the Bomb against him, making him weaker (he uses "only" his last Pokemon).
 You only have one chance of using this exploit because the Bomb is gone after you use it.
 Indeed, this event is completely optional, you can challenge Kifflom as you wish.
+ Now Professor Oak can use a different team that changes according to the Starter you have
 chosen at the beginning of the game, (somehow) resurrecting the unused Oak fighting concept
 that was scrapped during the development of Pokemon Red/Green.
+ The Trainer Card was overhauled: now it also shows you the ID Number, caught species,
 the Quests you have completed (1 star for each completed Quest), and it even shows
 the Power Gems you have collected (showing you both the total amount of collected Gems
 and which one you have got). Furthermore, Play Time is now automatically updated, and
 the colon between hours and minutes blinks (as in later Pokemon games).
 ° The trainer card itself was graphically re-designed, too.
+ The "X-Items" (X Attack, etc.) now raise the according Stat by 2 stages instead of 1,
  like in the newest Pokemon games.
+ You can now receive the Train Pass after helping Elza in Haven City, and you receive the
 Grip Shoes after defeating Steelhan in the Weapon Depot and talking to the President in there.
This means that you can travel between Frejo and Kelgo via Fast Train BEFORE getting access
 to the Weapon Depot in Silten City (the infamous "Bounty Killer sidequest", Hardat City, etc.).
+ Added a new shortcut for backtracking in Route 72, unlocked after you've passed past the
 guard inside the Route Gate found in there -- that is, when you've already showed the Acid Badge
 to the guard. A stairway next to the ledge previously blocking the road will appear.
This way you won't have to access this route any time by diving at the National Tunnel,
 this trip will be needed only before you unlock the first badge checkpoint: once this task is
 accomplished you can easily travel by land/water between Route 71, Route 72 and Route 73
 (that is, between Lauras City, Gadow City, and the Pokemon League).
+ Added a subway between Hardat City and its Port.
+ Pokemon Mart inventories have been significantly improved and rationalized.
+ Paul's teams have been improved, and the secondary pokemon he uses are no longer mis-matched.
 ° The final fight against Paul in the Crystal Palace/Grape Lodge now features its final form.
+ The Town Map is now (partially) colorized (as long as the game is run on GBC/GBA/Auto mode).
+ Now upon using the Cottage the game informs the player that the Party Pokemon were healed.
+ Added a few new items, albeit as of now those have no use (until I retouch the battle engine).

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			    -- Miscellaneous --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ De-capitalization: all-caps names have been adjusted according to the fashion of the latest
 Pokemon games (and hacks). Now the game won't yell at you every time.
+ The 2 Pokemon required to access Turtle Rock are now the base forms, not the last
 stage of evolution forms. This simplifies the puzzle a lot since you no longer have to
 train and evolve those two required Pokemon anymore. This was badly needed since Turtle Rock
 is a mandatory dungeon from Final 1.5 onwards (previously, its access was deliberately harder).
+ Triple Kick's single hit damage has been increased (from 10 to 20).
+ You can buy PokeDolls in Gondwan City's Mart 2F, so you can obtain the DoubleTeam TM earlier --
 and test the "PokeDoll oversight" fix (This Seal of Quality guarantees your... Ehrm... ;) ).
+ Moves using the One-Hit K.O. effect no longer determine its success on speed differences
 between the two Pokemon but on current HP: if the attacking Pokemon has more HP than the
 attacked Pokemon the move can potentially knock the opponent out -- if the move succeeds.
+ 100% of the front sprites for Pokemon are now newly drawn (as part of the "80C Spritesource"),
 this means that a few Pokemon feature brand new sprites (e.g: Tyranitar, Lugia, Rhyperior, etc.)
+ Driadjin has changed aspect significantly. It ought to be a PokeGod, thus now it has more a
 PokeGod-dish aspect and feeling (with the sprite simulating up to 6 colors, too).
+ Venomoth is now Wind/Poison type. This change was done so that now Venomoth roughly behaves
 as a "three-type" Pokemon (Bug, Flying, and Poison) while maintaining STAB for Poison moves
 and gaining one for its Wind-type moves. He gains neutral/normal damage against fire, tough.
+ "Brick Piece" is now called "Heavy Brick". The name was switched since this item is not
 related to the one from the Johto games.
+ The infamous "Big Blue" palette used in dark places, underwater, swamp etc. has been
 enlighted a little. Same goes for the "Big Brown" palette used in Rustel City, Home, Museum etc.
+ The Fish Factory's palette was reverted to its originally intended Grey-Blue palette.
+ The infamous "No Sleep 'till Brooklyn" sign in National Tunnel now reads "League Access
 Underwater" since the pond with the dark water in there is used to unlock Route 73.
+ A few dialogues were tweaked, either to give some more depth and insight or to correct issues
 or to include additional references or even just to make some more fun. At times a few more
 hints were provided.
+ This ReadMe and the Download Package:
 ° Included the New Type Chart image file in the download package. You can eventually print it
 for reference during fights if needed.
 ° Updated and fixed the New Type Chart embedded in this ReadMe and the image file version.
 ° Included this ReadMe in the download package.
 ° Removed the accented "e" character from the ReadMe file to improve readability/compatibility.
 ° Added navigation labels in the "Previous Versions" Section and in some more sub-sections.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Final 1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Release Date:			April 20th 2020
* Backward Compatible:		Yes
* Short Description:		Major update with several additions.

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			   -- Historical Notes --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Final 1.5 introduces a quite notable amount of additions and fixes since the previous release.
This release features the "Kelgo Expansion": players can explore additional locations
in Kelgo (the second Region), including a new City, an additional Kelgo route, and an
additional dungeon (Haven Forest). The "First Quest" features an expansion, too:
players need to explore the newly featured locations in Kelgo in order to unlock access
to the Weapon Depot in Frejo.
   Among the many newly introduced features there are the addition of roaming pokemon mechanics,
travel between regions via Fast Ship, the Move Tutor NPC in Kelgo, a partial "clock" engine
that is responsible both for changes to the palette used in the overworld and wild encounters
(and that affects the Dusk Ball's usage), the addition of several new NPCs featuring
new functions, among which there is the Outlaw Barber for shaving/cleaning your Pokemon
(allowing, among others, the Umbreon/Espeon evolution from Eevee).

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
				-- Fixes --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Fixed the infamous "Surf Everywhere" glitch in Route 72 that allowed the player to swim
 anywhere by keeping the B Button pressed just before surfing 0_0 .
 This also implies that you cannot any longer sequence-skip the diving part in Route 72.
+ Fixed a glitch that left players stuck if the Safari PA was called from the Rest Houses.
+ Chimecho's name is no longer misspelled.
+ In the Dungeon of Defrite's Sewers MissingNo cannot be encountered any longer. The water
 in there is indeed meant to spawn water Pokemon; however, due to an oversight in this data
 itself, water Pokemon were not loaded at all, resulting in this glitch. By fixing it now
 a different set of water Pokemon is found while walking amid the low-waters sections as
 originally meant (a further demonstration of how a single wrong byte can mess up everything).
+ Fixed all the "Double-Evolution Glitches" involving Eevee and its evolutions.
+ Sylveon can now be de-evolved thanks to De-Stone as originally meant.
+ The PokeDex now lists all 248 entries as meant. It no longer leaves out the last 8 entries.
 Thanks to this fix you can also view the Diploma in Grape Mansion upon PokeDex completion.
+ Fixed the bug that changed color for a split second when using items outside of battle
 or when failing item usage during battles.
+ Fixed all the erroneous Pokemon growth rates, some of them (mostly gen.2) were responsable
 of various level-up level/exp underflows and glitching.
+ Fighting-type moves are no longer effective against Ghost-type as meant.
+ Tyrogue's evolution into either Hitmonchan or Hitmonlee is no longer swapped.
+ Fixed the walking guys you follow in Megan City via event: they no longer change
 their appearence upon stopping on destination.
+ Many trainers with faulty sight range have been fixed so you cannoty skip them anymore.
+ In Lauras City's Gym trainers no longer walk through walls.
+ The Lying Item Balls in Restricted Area are no longer shown as boulders.
+ all the TM/HM compatibility issues with some Pokemon species are now fixed.
+ Sleeping now lasts for a maximum of 3 turns instead of 7 and a minimum of 2 turns.
+ When a Pokemon wakes up from sleep it no longer wastes its turn, it will use
 the last selected\used move (which will go under the usual move hitting checks).
+ Using Snag Ball during Trainer Battles now displays the correct animation,
 it no longer uses the animation of the trainer blocking the PokeBall.
+ Special PokeBalls display the UltraBall\MasterBall animation upon usage.
+ The texbox of the fat guy (Morshu!) in Haven Train Station who sells the Starter
 Pokemon (as a black market vendor) is now loaded automatically without delay.
+ Kart usage in maps has been improved; a few more route gates can now be
 accessed on Kart; A few sections where the Kart is not supposed to be used now
 disable the Kart correctly as meant (notably Route 70's Route Gate downstairs).
+ You cannot use the Kart in Dante's Gym anymore.
+ The fisher in Paceleaf who gives you TM37 now states in his dialogue the correct TM.
+ The Thief Rocket who gives you TM46 now states in his dialogue the correct TM.
+ Palette displaying in maps has been greatly improved, all oversights regarding
 palette loading for certain maps (eg: Port, Dungeon of Defrite & others) have
 been fixed. A lot of maps now feature new colors (eg: Paul's Villa, Battle Tower).
+ Route 65 is now snowy! :)
+ Articuno's area in Wizard Peak is now icy in colors, no more brown ice.
+ Mt.Lyre top is now snowy too as it is supposed to be a glacier.
+ When activating the Roaming Dogs event they no longer disappear abruptly, there's
 now a flashing animation. This was intended for Final Version 1.0 but apparently
 it was accidentally cleared/erased out as a result of an oversight.
+ Fixed a few grammar mistakes left here and there during the years.

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
				-- Add-Ons --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Added Roaming Pokemon Mechanics! Try to hunt down Raikou, Entei and Suicune :)
+ Added the Scouter usage: if it is held in the Player's Bag it beeps automatically
 if one of the 3 Roaming Pokemon is in your area upon entering.
+ Added usage for Honey: it maximizes the encounter rate of land-spawned Pokemon.
 The encounter rate is reset after either encountering a wild Pokemon or battling a trainer.
 Useful in the Safari Zone and for searching for Roaming Pokemon, especially if players do
 not use/do not have the "speed-booster" on their emulator (or perhaps even console).
+ Added new explorable areas in Kelgo along with a new Fly-able location, Hardat City.
 This is the aforementioned "Kelgo Expansion", included due to popular demand.
+ In Hardat City you will find the Move Tutor, like in Gen.3+ games.
 Thanks to him you can also consult the movesets of your Pokemon. 
+ In Hardat City you will also find the Pokemon Smeller, this is a new novelty feature.
+ Hardat City also features a good amount of unique events.
+ Hardat City also features its own Mart where Honey is sold.
+ Once Hardat City is marked as explored you can use the Fast Ship between Frejo and Kelgo.
 Simply enter the ship, enter the northernmost cabin on the top-left struct of cabins and
 you will find an empty room with a different shape, alongside a suspicious bed. Interacting
 with it will give you the possibility to rest there (healing Pokemon) and let the ship depart.
 ° Note 1: Once the ship has arrived you cannot travel back by sleeping in that bed (any future
 usage of it will only heal your Pokemon party); you have to quit the ship first and repeat
 the procedure if you want to travel once more (even if you saved and resetted the game).
 The main exit to the ship always leads you to the original port where you entered there first,
 unless you've triggered the voyage via resting in the bed. Interacting with this bed
 before visiting Hardat City will simply heal your Party Pokemon.
 ° Note 2: You have to heal your Pokemon at the Hardat PokeCenter if you want to unlock this feature.
+ Added an explorable route in Kelgo, Route 76, connecting Haven City with Hardat City.
+ Added a new dungeon located on Route 76, Haven Forest, part of the new sidequest.
+ Added some rudimentary clock functions - you can have a preview in Haven Forest:
 two sages in there can either randomly change the part of day or reset it altogether.
+ Added a Barber NPC in Haven Forest (Kelgo) who can evolve a few Pokemon species!
+ Golbat and Chansey evolve respectively into Crobat and Blissey thanks to the Outlaw Barber
 in Haven Forest. Eevee can now also evolve into either Umbreon or Espeon based on the
 part of day and having a shave by the very same Barber.
+ The four Optional Dungeons (PokeBall Factory, Fast Ship, Fish Factory, Turtle Rock)
 are no longer optional, they're mandatory as part of the sidequest to unlock Weapon Depot.
+ As a consequence, two of the four Underwater Maps are no longer optional/skippable.
+ There's no chance of remaining stuck without accessing Turtle Rock if you're short of
 funds, in Haven Forest one of the NPCs will provide you enough money every time you're below
 a certain amount. This can also be wisely exploited to gain money every time before completing
 the quest, which can be in turn be used in Rare Candies to level up your Pokemon :D
+ Added the THIEF move effect! Steal your opponent's item! ;)
 (Held items aren't implemented yet, unless you trade to G\S\C).
+ The Nidorino and Gengar fight intro has been fully colorized, with each Pokemon using its
 own color =) -- if the game is ran on Automatic\GBC\GBA modes of course.
+ Rustel City's Mart now sells way more items, with new additions including repels,
 awakening, burn heal (wild vulpix/ember) and ice heal (Elias/Freezebreath).
+ Added a second floor/lookout spot in Gondwan's Route Gate.
+ Added new House interiors in Snorkel City and Gondwan City.
+ Added (basically) a PokeCenter in Safari Zone Area 4 inside the Rest House.
 This mimicks an earlier concept from the Pokemon Green/Red betas where players were
 supposed to be able to use the rest houses to heal their Pokemon. Also, upon healing
 there and using teleport/dig somewhere else leads you to the last visited PokeCenter
 rather than that particular rest house, this was an unused function of the Green/Red
 Beta that was left in the Final Game by the developers that I used to full advantage. 
+ Gondwan City has been slightly redesigned to include waterfalls.
+ Added new battle animations for Metal Claw, Dragon Claw, Hydro Cannon, Flash Wave,
 Zap Cannon, Gem Bomb and Frenzy Plant.
+ Added a sub-routine that is capable of loading the appropriate set of palettes
 based on day/night mechanics for external areas (cities, routes, ports, forests, the
 external area of the battle tower). Quartz Town and Route 65 keep their white
 snowy palette during day. The Port keeps its orange palette during day.
+ A new grey/blue palette for Buildings/Dungeons has been added.

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			    -- Miscellaneous --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ The Council Estate has been moved from Route 52 to Hardat City, Kelgo. Now it also acts
 as a Route Gate between Hardat City and Route 76, which is better than having a useless
 building amidst Route 52 (this was a remnant of the Demos where the Council Estate acted
 as a Route gate between Megan City and Route 52, this is no longer necessary so it went).
+ Reworked many NPCs' sprites who now have more a FireRed/LeafGreen feeling.
+ The 3 Fisher Gurus (Snorkel, Gondwan and Haven City) have now the fisher's new sprite.
+ Now there's a Poliwhirl NPC in the 3rd Fisher Guru's house. Also, the Sandshrew NPC in the
 House on Route 64 (beside the "abandoned hospital") is now capable of walking.
+ Textbox16 has been substituted with a rock/white-ish textbox.
 I felt Textbox16 was too similar with Textbox15, and since there were way too many
 colorful and black textboxes I decided to tweak the former one to add variety.
+ Added some sillyness in a few more dialogues. Added also a few more hints.
+ Player's garage is now displayed with a red palette (and so is the screenshot found there).
+ Fish Factory is much more radioactive in colors now, see by yourself.
+ The Gruntette/Epsilon-Wannabe/CoolTrainerF found in the fish factory is now located in
 the area PAST the Underwater section of Fish Factory.
+ The Rest House in Safari Zone North-West (Area 3) has been moved a bit northwards.
+ Removed 2 "bench guys" from 2 Safari Rest Houses and 3 PCs from there since they
 were quite redundant and unuseful. You can still find the Wheelchair guy and the PC
 in the Rest House in Safari Zone Area 3 where you can eventually store/withdraw Pokemon.
 You can access the PC both from the Safari Zone Entrance and the Rest House in the 3rd
 Area, which is halfway the Safari Zone Path so it is quite useful -- especially if you're
 visiting the Safari Zone without Safari Mode (thanks to the "New Safari Trick").
 The Healing Machine in the 4th Resthouse instead is helpful for healing Pokemon party
 either if they're exhausted from wild battles or eventually from the trainer battles in
 Area 5 (assuming you saved enough steps). In any case, the Safari Zone is now better.
+ This ReadMe: updated, corrected a few typos, polished a few sections a bit, added
 sub-chapters in the "FAQ" Section and in the "Previous Versions" Section.
 Added also a few more specifications in the FAQ Section about the new features.

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			 -- Update Instructions --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Note 0: When "upgrading" and carrying your older savefile, save your game in a PokeCenter
 or in the Player's Room in your older version.
 Do NOT save in any other map as a few maps had been moved through memory locations in order
 to save space for the new features and thus may give you a freeze upon loading.
 Avoid at all costs these maps, do not save in there before "upgrading":
 Gondwan City, Mt.Lyre (Sidescroll), Council Estate maps, Mart Basement, all Snorkel House
 interiors, Route 66 Route Gate (the guard's building), all Gondwan City's House interiors
 (except the "Racket House"), Fisher's House/Gate in Gondwan, Haven City external, the
 Safari Rest Houses, the Safari Zone (especially Area 3), all Haven City's interior houses
 (except Move Deleter's House), the last map in Spooky Swamp, Weapon Depot maps and
 Silten City (the external area -- PC and Mart are safe).

# Note 1: This version *might* cause a few *fixable in-game* minor side issues that have to
 do with _saved progress_, as a part of the expansion. Absolutely nothing worrying tough.
These issues won't affect gameplay at all if either you:
 a) Already completed the game or completed at least the First Quest (up to the Pokemon League);
 b) Played up to the point of getting the Ghost Scope, but before defeating the Rockets
 who hold Abe as hostage in Spooky Swamp;
 c) or if you are starting a new game (not necessary/not mandatory at all).
The issues aforementioned are:
 1) You can Fly to Hardat City (Kelgo) if you already visited Battle Tower;
 2) If you want to Fly to Battle Tower again simply visit its external area once more;

# Note 2: Players with an already existing savefile played up to the point of receiving
 the PokeFlute won't have that Kelgo side-mission to unlock the Weapon Depot as
 mandatory (it will be optional) while in the newly created savefiles this sidetracking
 has to be completed first in order to access Weapon Depot.

[GOOD NEWS]
# Note 3: Players who for some reason had the movesets of their Pokemon messed up from
 the "Evolution Glitch" from Final 1.0 can now fix in-game the moveset of these Pokemon by
 visiting the Move Tutor in Hardat City, Kelgo. The Move Tutor is very useful for letting
 your Pokemon learn previously forgotten moves, either for deleting them or because the
 caught Pokemon had been already quite levelled up. This is even more useful in case of
 Pokemon who can evolve only with a particular move in their moveset and who had never
 learnt it (or whose evolution had been blocked and the move had later been deleted).
 Also, you can easily view the movesets of your Pokemon up to their level :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Final 1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Release Date:			January 20th 2020
* Backward Compatible:		Yes
* Short Description:		Major Update.

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
				-- Fixes --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Levers and Switches in the Underground portion of the Panopticon no longer
 reset upon encountering a wild Pokemon in the area and/or upon resetting
 the game. Keep in mind that they _do_ reset upon entering/exiting the map
 as it is an intended feature of the puzzle;
+ Fixed a glitch where the Player could get stuck in Paul's Villa.
 This resulted from a remnant of the Demos where, as a secret trick, one
 would get access to the HM found there very earlier than usual thanks to
 an exploit that lets you pass past the blocking guards.
 Now a 1-way teleporter is found in that area: it sends the player back to
 the entrance enabling her\him to go past the blocking guys and exit the dungeon.
+ The game can now handle differently Dive and Bounce during battles, those moves
 have now their intended 2-stage+invulnerability effect. In addition, the game
 now has a custom unique message for both moves being used.
+ The Item Diviner in Hotel California now correctly guesses items, now she
 also detects TMs/HMs being used and she is no longer tricked by the use of
 dummy items by Field Moves (Surf and Dig).
+ Substitute no longer makes its user faint by leaving it with 0 HP.
+ Substitute's mini-sprite has been added/fixed.
+ Leech Seed cannot be used anymore on an opponent's substitute.
+ Leech Seed is no longer effective against Wood-Type Pokemon.
+ Rest is now able of clearing out the badly poisoned status (and its multiplier).
+ The "extra Ghost Scope" on Route 72 had been replaced with a Dope Ball as meant.
+ The Relics' Texbox shown during the Relic trading has been enlarged and fixed.
+ Magnitude has been replaced with Mud Shot. Since it's no longer based on the
 semi-random damage behavior of Psywave, which apparently ignores type combinations,
 it cannot any longer hurt Pokemon whose types are immune to Ground (Flying, Gas);
+ Aurora Beam has been changed back to Ice-type;
+ Struggle now hits regardless of type combination;
+ PokeDex entries for Natu, Ampharos, Tyranitar, Gligar, Espeon, Blissey and Ho-Oh
 had erroneous text characters that are now fixed.
+ The TM02 in Route 67 is now correctly shown as a lying PokeBall item.
+ Steelix's and Scizor's Base EXP have been corrected.
+ Phanpy's and Tangrowth's names are no longer mispelled.
+ Enemy Pokemon's AI slightly fixed and improved.
+ Flannery has no longer two Ninetales, one of them is now a Magmar.
 Also, upon defeating her, she's no longer named by the game "Chief".

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
				-- Add-Ons --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Added the "Secret TM Vendors" in Crystal Island at the very end of the 2nd Quest.
 They are "talking tombs" that sell in groups every TM found in the game as a bonus
 prize for beating the game - this was an intended feature of Final 1.0 but, huh,
 I'm afraid I totally forgot about them after half a decade 0_0 .
+ Card Key doors in the Grape Lodge\Crystal Island Dungeon are now fully functional,
 they lead to the Hall of Fame as a kind of alternate ending - it's another
 reward for the completion of the 2nd Quest;
+ Added the additional Move effects for Rapid Spin! Its user can get rid of Leech Seed
 upon usage, can potentially free from Trapping Moves (once I have retouched the latter)
 and after attacking it also raises the user's speed by one stage like in Gen.8 games!
+ Route 54 now features a bog/swamp layout in its western part. It feels more in
 touch with the wizardry-themed area.
+ Jynx has now violet skin rather than black, like its official version.

			   -- Historical Notes --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There was no Final Version 1.3 because that version was reworked into this one
before it could be released. Final 1.4 amended the previous versions by featuring
a notable amount of important fixes and addons both for the overworld and fighting engine.

Final 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Release Date:			January 11th 2020
* Backward Compatible:		Yes
* Short Description:		Bug Fixing\Improvements.

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			      -- Change Log --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Fixed Flannery's Pokemon team: she no longer has that Lv.104 Rapidash O_O -- now
 she has her usual team, with the addition of a Flareon (for a total of 6 Pokemon).
+ Added a shortcut in Fracture Hill to allow fast backtracking between Snorkel City and
 Paceleaf City. Once you can use Surf, the shortcut can be accessed in both
 directions, shortening times considerably (especially for players who missed the HM02);
+ Added a healing bag near the entrance of Fracture Hill: players can heal their
 party Pokemon upon entering the dungeon without having to backtrack to Paceleaf City.
+ The two sleeping Snorlax are no longer misrepresented as lying PokeBalls.
+ The Town Map in Peach's house is no longer misrepresented as a bag.
+ Added a fix for the "Swamp Square Trick": the healing square could trigger the
 "MissingNo. Glitch" upon stepping on a particular spot, albeit there was a very low
 (yet existing) chance. Wild Pokemon were effectively spawned on the other tiles too
 (regular pokemon in this case), thus those tiles were reprogrammed in such a way that
 they will not spawn wild Pokemon in any case.
The glitch above could eventually trigger a fight with MissingNo. #000, that glitches
 the bag's content upon encounter, making the game read garbage data because of an
 unintended expansion of the total amount of items contained in the bag.
 For players who have had this unfortunate encounter, here's how to fix it.
---> How to fix it in older savegames: Count the number of regular items you had in the
 bag before encountering MissingNo, then enter this Gameshark cheat: 01??1dd3
 where "??" is the hexadecimal value representing the total amount of items you carry in
 the bag -- convert your decimal number in Hexadecimal with a calculator and there you go
 (eg: 10 ---> 0A).

Final 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Release Date:			January 6th 2020
* Backward Compatible:		Yes
* Short Description:		Bug Fixing\Improvements.

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			      -- Change Log --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ The infamous "Evolution Glitch" that occurred upon regular levelling up after fighting
  -- that affected Pikachu, Kadabra, and many others -- is no longer there;
+ The "Old Man Glitch" triggered by the Gambler at the exit of Mt.Lyre has been fixed;
+ Fixed the sprite of the boy in Megan City pleading you to save Megan City (a wrong digit);
+ Dante's Gym now matches the intended volcanic\hell layout as meant;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Final 1.0 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Release Date:			December 31st 2019
* Backward Compatible:		No
* Short Description:		The first (botched) release of the Final game.

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			      -- Change Log --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There were too many changes from Final 1.0 and the previously published version --
"Demo 3.1", dated July 2015 -- to be listed here. The developer wrote that "of those [years],
3 [...] were dedicated to debugging [and] [...] improvements here and there".
In comparison, the Demos were "Developement\Beta versions".

			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			   -- Historical Notes --
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The "master patch" was based on a slightly older developement version of Grape that
did not feature some last-minute bug fixes and changes that were meant for Final 1.0,
this meant that the first release _was not_ "the" final release, and it was glitchy.
   What was published was instead a development built dated a few days earlier
that was misplaced and mistaken for the Final. That built lacked some serious fixes and
features that were not included until the last minute.
