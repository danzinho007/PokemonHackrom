Unova Red is a ROM hack of Pokemon Red Version. This game replaces the Generation 1 Pokedex with that of Generation 5, as Unova's Pokedex was intentionally designed to work as a standalone without any additional Pokemon from other generations. All 156 Pokemon from Gen 5 are included in Unova Red, including all legendary and mythical Pokemon. Pay attention to your surroundings, you may notice something that wasn't there in the original games. For example, keep an eye out when you first enter Cerulean City.

Aside from the new Pokemon, the game functions primarily the same as the original. The biggest difference is the inclusion of Dark and Steel types. This game uses the type matchup chart as it existed in Gen 5. In addition, several new moves have been added into the game. Many of these exist so that Dark and Steel type Pokemon will have STAB attacks to use. Others are to flesh out some underrepresented types, and others are signature moves of certain Gen 5 Pokemon. This was done at the exclusion of an equivalent number of moves that existed in Gen 1, all either signature moves of Gen 1 Pokemon, or moves that simply did not fit very well with the Pokemon of Gen 5.

Due to this game being a ROM hack, all trade evolutions were changed to either normal level-up evolutions, or certain items. Friendly evolutions were changed as well. Also, due to the fact that the Kanto games' main plot is shorter than that of the Unova games, some of the evolution levels of certain Pokemon were lowered to be more reasonable within the context of the length of a Gen 1 playthrough. 

A few TMs were also altered, though in general, the feel of a Gen 1 game was maintained. This includes Pokemon learing pretty few STAB moves in general, and certain TMs being rather useful. So it may be a good idea to preserve those good ones. This game also has not made an attempt to "fix" the somewhat wonky feel of Gen 1's mechanics, though there have been a few changes. For example, Focus Energy will now work as intended, and the type effectiveness errors have been fixed. Attributes of attacks, such as base power, PP, and accuracy have, in general, been updated to match how they existed in Gen 5. Notably however, the super effective/not very effective text still functions the same as it did in Gen 1, so it will display incorrectly at times, though it will always calculate properly. Moves are also still determined as Physical or Special based on type, though Ghost has been changed to a Special type, and Dark has been changed to Physical.

HOW TO PLAY:
This game can be played with the same software as any other Gameboy ROM. For those unfamiliar with Gameboy ROMs, you will need an emulator. The one I have is Visualboy Advance. Once you run VBA, you can select "Run Gameboy" from the file menu, and select Unova Red. 

ONE MORE THING. VBA will default to playing the game in black and white. You can also play this game in color by selecting "Gameboy" from the Options tab, and clicking the SGB setting. Do this before opening the ROM.
