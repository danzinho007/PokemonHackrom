In case you're stuck, as from feedback I've realised several things are unclear from a player's perspective

---------MAIN STORY---------
The pre-game story should be linear to follow, from the NPCs' dialogue.

Granite Cave: B1F and B2F are unlocked after the quake
Cozmo: He runs to the upper left room of Meteor Falls
After Mt Pyre Summit: Go to Lavaridge Pokemon Center and talk to Sidney
After Archie escapes with the submarine: Talk to the grunts blocking the Aqua Hideout

Ability changer: This is a Devon scientist working on a dream device. After the 5th badge, you can select a Pokemon to dream, and the Pokemon's ability will "cycle" to the next ability.

---------POST GAME---------

--Delta Episode (post-game)--
1. After beating the E4 for the first time, go home and watch the news.
2. Go to Devon Corps and accept the mission
3. Steven will call you after the events, go to his house
4. Go to Sky Pillar and talk to Rayquaza
--The boss will have +6 in all stats the first battle. If you lose, it will have +2 in Atk, SpA and Speed, +6 in Def/SpDef in the second battle. After that, it will vanish

--Altering Cave (after Delta Episode)--
1. Bring the Soul Dew to Eternal Flower Floette
2. After leaving, Lance will call you. Go to Cove Lily Motel to speak to him
3. Go to Altering Cave at Route 103

--Alternate Dimension (after Altering Cave Episode)--
1. Go to Cove Lily Motel and talk to Cynthia
2. Mr. Stone will call you, go to Mr Briney at his Route 104 home
3. On S.S. Tidal, talk to Lille, then go downstairs. There is a particular spot (straight down)
4. After S.S. Tidal, talk to Cynthia again
5. Bring a Cosmog, Solgaleo or Lunala to the Cave of Origin. If you do not have one in the party, Necrozma will continuously regenerate
6. Navigate the messed-up place. The walkable area and teleportation triggers are provided in the maps folder/. In general, try to walk towards Uxie, Mesprit and Azelf
--Alternate ending: Have Diancie with Diancite in your party before battling Zinnia
To re-enter after exiting: go to Cave of Origin (the center-bottom place where Wallace usually stands) with Cosmog/Solgaleo/Lunala as lead Pokemon

---------SIDE QUESTS---------
--Stat trainers--
-Cheryl is in Petalburg Woods, bring her to the north exit
-Riley and Mira are in Granite Cave B2F, bring one to the other
-Buck is in Fiery Path after Team Magma leaves Mt Chimney. To complete his quest, find the three hidden Nuggets and then go to the dead end
-Marley is on the Abandoned Ship. To complete her quest, find the Storage Key and read the log in the Storage Room bag
After each trainers’ quest is done, they will appear at Cove Lily Motel 2F, and will give you berries and EV-training battles. Post-game, they can be battled

--Walda--
Bring Walda's dad dolls. The doll to bring her can be found by talking to an NPC in Dewford Town Hall
After that, give Walda a Pokemon
Keldeo will be unlocked as a post-game encounter in Route 114

Go to Fiery Path’s dead end and encounter the Magma Grunt there
Go to the Magma Hideout's end, battle Tabitha
Unlocks Victini (talk to it)

--Shelly (Post-game, Marley’s quest completed)--

Go up Mt Pyre’s interior floors
After Mt Pyre's interior's completion, Spiritomb can be found as a post-game encounter at Mt Pyre 5F
To go back to EFF, the hole can be walked-into post-game (required to cleanse the Soul Dew)

--Reimi--
Talk to Reimi in Slateport City to get Arnold
Talk to NPCs in Lilycove City; if Arnold is in the party, you’ll get an alert; if Arnold has evolved, the quest will proceed

Hope this helps, and thanks for playing :)
