********************************
V1.0.1

----BUG FIXES----
1. Fix party being lost if the player whited out during the EFF-Spiritomb battle
2. Fix S.S.Tidal being immediately boardable after the Delta Meteoroid due to an error in the ticket check
3. Fix Zekrom's script being a last-minute test leftover
4. Fix pokemon_locations.txt mistakes (Larvitar, Natu, Delibird, Taillow, Flabebe and Noibat)

----Other changes----
1. Reduced/removed some sturdy-grunt fights after feedback that they were tedious. Those who remain have two sturdy Pokemon at most
2. Placed very explicit warnings to save before the Mt Pyre Summit fight
3. Replaced a fight in Victory Road that had a Shell Bell Aron (in case the player has absolutely no way to multi-hit due to playthrough rules)
4. Added explicit dialogue with Lance for directions after the Delta Episode
5. Ghetsis' fight, even if lost, will continue (although during testing there appears to be no issue, just to be safe, and it's indeed odd to re-run through the dialogue)
5. Removed leftover Memories (their existence will not harm the game, but Plates are used for RKS System and Multi-Attack). NPCs who gave Memories will give purchaseable Gems instead
6. Added the following items missing in 1.0: Charizardite-X, Absolite, Flyinium-Z, Lunalium-Z, Lycanium-Z and Tapunium-Z
7. Bug Maniac in Fortree City now gives rewards for every Vivillon shown, instead of only specific numbers
8. Added triggers to suggest where Cozmo ran to in Meteor Falls
9. Meltan's base friendship has been boosted to 35 (note: this will still have a chance of disobedience)
10. Genesect has been moved to a one-time encounter in Altering Cave, with the normal wild encounters being replaced with Smeargles
11. Reshiram's requirement now accepts Therian formes
12. Improved but incomplete documentation (item_locations.txt), hidden items in Buck's sidequest, Vivillon locations etc

----COMPATIBILITY----
V1.0.1 is compatible with V1.0 saves, but please take note of the following:
-If you're trapped in S.S.Tidal without the S.S. Tidal ticket, talk to the exit sailor who'll drop you at Lilycove's Cove Lily Motel
-If you've lost your party after exiting EFF's location and saved after that, unfortunately they'll be unrecoverable, apologies. Same if you saved after Mt Pyre's fight
-If you've defeated Ghetsis but not already caught a Genesect, Genesect will now be unavailable, apologies
-If you've already shown the Bug Maniac Vivillons, some non-critical items will be missed, but the Buginium-Z and Insect Plate are still obtainable

Very sorry that there're bugs found so quickly after release. Will be more thorough in testing in the future. Thanks to those who played and reported bugs :)
