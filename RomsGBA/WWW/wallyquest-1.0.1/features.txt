*********************************************************************************
Wally Quest v1.0.1
*********************************************************************************
Hello, this is my first ROMhack attempt, a simple, plot-centric game based on RHH's battle engine.
The story is based on Emerald and ORAS, with additions into the main plotline, a new rival/antagonist, sidequests and post-game episodes.
There is also a bit of a catch-them-all subtheme.
Play as Wally, go out and explore Hoenn, make friends and save the world!

*********************************************************************************
Plot
*********************************************************************************
This ROMhack is an alternate reality with Wally as the protagonist. It takes elements from Emerald and ORAS but is not otherwise faithful to details
-Longer pre-E4 plot up to level 85
-Additional rival/antagonist
-Delta and other post-game "episodes"
-Additional side "quests"
-Various adjusted NPC dialogue, e.g. daily egg and berry givers, Professors

Some interpretations based on questions from the mainstream game:
-What if Maxie and Archie had gotten the correct Orbs?
-What did Wally's dad want to tell Wally after the 5th Gym?

Warnings:
-I've an unkind reinterpretation of the antagonists, which are existing Pokemon characters
-Although I believe I've avoided sensitive content, I may be ignorant of some sensibilities. Also, some antagonist dialogue are intended to irk
-Some creepypasta are referenced
-The story is dark at times

*********************************************************************************

*********************************************************************************
Move changes
*********************************************************************************

Frustration and Return have their power improved to 127 maximum
Hidden Power is Type Dark as a result of the IV changes
Multi-Attack now works with Plates instead of Memories

*********************************************************************************
Items
*********************************************************************************

The Old Rod is the only fishing rod in game, and can fish different Pokemon
Evolution stones are now reusable Key Items
Two new pockets: Battle items (held items) and Special (plates, Mega Stones, Z-Crystals)
EV-reducing berries subtract EVs by 20. They increase friendship by: 5 when friendship is low, 10 at medium, 2 at high
Energy Root, Energy Powder, Heal Powder and Revival Herb decrease friendship by: 10 when friendship is low, 5 at medium, 0 at high

There are no hidden items except for those related to specific events

*********************************************************************************
EVs
*********************************************************************************

EVs are now used as Contest Conditions:
-HP: Sheen
-Attack: Coolness
-Defense: Toughness
-Speed: Cuteness
-SpA: Beauty
-SpD: Smartness

*********************************************************************************
Mega Evolution and Z-Moves
*********************************************************************************

In addition to the normal requirements, the player can only Mega Evolve a Pokemon if the Pokemon is at maximum friendship
Mega Evolutions and Z-moves can both be used in the same battle

*********************************************************************************
Diligence - Soft level cap
*********************************************************************************

"Diligence" is a soft level cap that is raised after acquiring badges
0 badges: 18
1 badge: 24
2 badges: 30
3 badges: 40
4 badges: 45
5 badges: 50
6 badges: 65
7 badges: 75
8 badges: 85
After E4: 100

Note: You will likely hit the level cap at stages in the game

The soft level cap will divide the EXP gained in battle by 8
Because of this mechanic, Prof Oak challenges will be difficult, so recommend adjusting the rules

*********************************************************************************
HMs/Field TMs
*********************************************************************************
HMs and Field TM functionalities are now all optional, or available through some other means
-There should be no trees to Cut
-If there are smashable rocks, they're not actually smashable but deliberate obstacles
-If there are boulders, they're deliberate obstacles or can be moved without Strength (just interact with it)
-Upon getting the Surfboard you can just jump into water, and later you can dive and climb waterfalls with it
-There is a Flying service at every town, the lady will allow you to Fly after beating the Fortree Gym
--There is a mild bug in this, that your last location for Teleport/white-out will not be updated to the town flown to this way
-Flash: The only places that allow Flash will have a wild Pokemon nearby that can learn it

*********************************************************************************
Trading
*********************************************************************************

This game cannot trade across playthroughs/different ROMS. In particular the Pokemon data structures have been altered
However, there are a large number of in-game trades
Trading no longer affects disobedience

*********************************************************************************
Disobedience
*********************************************************************************

Disobedience is now based on a threshold of friendship:
0 badges: 60
2 badges: 50
4 badges: 40
6 badges: 30
8 badges: 20
If your Pokemon's friendship is higher than the threshold, it will not disobey you in battle
Below the threshold, the probability of disobedience is (threshold - friendship) / threshold
When disobeying, the Pokemon will loaf around as an action
Frustration will ignore this; the Pokemon will use Frustration except when friendship is 0

0 FRIENDSHIP: The Pokemon will not obey you, even with Frustration, and hurt itself

In general this mechanic shouldn't appear except with legendaries, pseudo-legendaries and a few Pokemon.

*********************************************************************************

You can only have one Secret Base

Future
*********************************************************************************
The following are the future intended changes (besides bugfixes):
A patch for type, pokemon, move and ability changes

Improve difficulty (one way or the other, please feedback)
Improve gameplay, plot (please feedback)
Bugfixes
Better documentation

Please note that while I'll try to keep older saves compatible, there may be a point where a new game is required, e.g. Overhauling pokemon structs, plot changes, item position changes. Will warn if this happens
