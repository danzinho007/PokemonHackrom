BUGS
************
The following are bugs still existing in v1.0.1:

-After battles with Steven as your partner, the party may become corrupted. This has been somewhat inconsistent to reproduce, so recommend to save at two points: Mount Pyre summit and Sootopolis battle.
--A warning point has been added, please save immediately each time before going upwards. Apologies for the trouble
-When using the flying lady's service, the last city does not update; thus e.g. Teleport and whiteout will bring you to the previous city instead
-Various moves and abilities may not work as expected (e.g. Round and Pledges), as their effects are not yet/fully implemented in the Battle Engine
-Form change in battle may be buggy
-Mega symbols may remain even when the Mega-Evolved Pokemon has been switched out/fainted, is harmless thus far
-A wrong-palette version of Brendan's sprite may appear at times (e.g. when decorating Secret Base), is harmless thus far
-There has been no stress test on bag and pc limits
-Time based events tested fine on mGBA and VBA-M on Windows desktop, but am unsure of other emulators
-Rayquaza's colour is off during battle (black instead of green); have been unable to fix the problem yet, should be harmless
-The Battle Frontier was not thoroughly tested, so please beware of issues

Please highlight if there are any other problems
