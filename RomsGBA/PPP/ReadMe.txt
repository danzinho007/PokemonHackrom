3. Bugs
-Doesn't work on regular VBA, use VBA-M instead
-Bugs that occur on mGBA (and probably on the actual GBA and the 3DS):
--Highlighting Protector in the bag menu will crash the game
--Torkoal's attacks will freeze the game
-Roaming Lati@s bugs:
--Its HP and status resets between every battle
--It doesn't change location after fleeing
--It continues to roam after capture or defeat
-Breeding mechanics are partially broken:
--New added Pokémon produce same species instead of their pre-evolved form (Leafeon produces another Leafeon, not an Eevee; bug may be exclusive to Eevee though)
--Some Pokémon straight up never hatch (for example, Chingling)
--Some Pokémon Eggs freeze the game when you try to take them from the Day-Care Man (for example Heracross, Pinsir)
It is recommended to save before taking an egg and backup that save file until the egg hatches
-Battle facilities saving bug: loading save files made during your Battle Tent or any of Battle Frontier facilities challenge erases all your Pokédex data and all items from Items and Key items pockets. Could also occur when loading saves made during trades, but it's not confirmed. Be sure to use save states instead while challenging battle facilities. After your leave the facility, you can save your game manually and it will be fine
-When you switch out Mega Evolved Pokémon, it reverts back to its regular form
-Glitched rotating doors in Fortree Gym. Can be fixed by entering any menu
-Sometimes Pokémon can Mega Evolve on their own
-"Opposing trainer sends out your Pokémon" text appear in battle sometimes
-Groudon, Kyogre and Rayquaza stay Primal/Mega after capture, they revert to their regular forms after any battle
-Link features between two Delta Emerald roms don't work (but seems like they work when connecting Delta Emerald to vanilla Emerald or any other game)
-Numerous battle engine bugs (Ghost-type Pokémon immune to Fairy-type moves, missing move animations etc.)
-Numerous minor graphical glitches
