0) THIS ROM HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED USING MGBA VERSION 0.9.2 (other versions of MGBA the multiplayer code will not work or will not work reliably)
1) Apply IPS patch, to a legally aquired copy of Emerald ROM
2) In order to play multiplayer no AI, you will first need to set up two copies of Emerald with the patch, and set up a save file for each
respective copy.
	i) I recommend having the save files be right after setting the clock in the house and walking out of the players main house
3) After both save files are setup, launch MGBA 0.9.2, start p1 game, load p1 save
4) IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THIS NEXT STEP YOU ARE NOT USING SPEEDUP
5) Under MGBA Menu, File -> New Multiplayer Window, launch P2 Game and load p2 save file. DO NOT USE SPEED UP WHEN LAUNCHING MULTIPLAYER WINDOW!!!!!
6) Once both games save files are loaded, in P1 game, open start menu and select LINK option. Then in P2 game, open start menu select LINK option
	i) The link steps will then proceed, in P1 game you will need to press the mapped "a" button several times but once menus close out games will be linked
7) At this time it is safe to use speed up.
8) ONCE GAMES ARE IN LINKED YOU CAN NO LONGER USE SAVE STATES, ONLY IN GAME SAVES WILL WORK!!!!! WE RECOMMEND SAVING OFTEN AS IF THE LINK IS EVER DISCONNECTED
BOTH GAMES WILL CRASH!!!
9) Any TRAINER battle triggered by P1 will automatically pull p2 into a battle as the opponent (wild battles are vanilla)
10) P2 should stay static outside of battle and not move the player around at all
11) I recommend set heal/restore point at pc as whiting out and returning to players mom's house can sometimes cause the game to crash
