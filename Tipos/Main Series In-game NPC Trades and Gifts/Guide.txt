Generation 1:

-All trades and gifts in this Generation have random IVs, Gender, and a Shiny possibility.

French: Dresseur
Italian: Allenatore
Spanish: Entrenador

-Nothing in the Unused folder can legally be transferred to generation 7+ (Beedrill and Pidgeot can be legal when sent to said generation(s), but not with French, Italian, or Spanish OTs as shown above).
