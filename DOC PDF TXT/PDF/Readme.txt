						~ ~~POKéMON MARBLE - By BARO~~ ~
							     BETA 2
Treat it softly, as if it were a condom vending machine.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second update to pokemon marble, which was first though to be a follow up to quartz, but got put a bit apart.
Not compatible with quartz, although trade with 'ruby' will be disabled.
It has some good old pokemon, better old unseen pokemon and brand new pokemon. They'll be 251 in last beta and you'll be able
to catch them all (TM), and get the national dex award.

BETATESTER? WHAT BETATESTER?
 This is a beta, and you are the one betatesting it. Congrats!
Any report of bugs will be apreciated. Who knows, maybe in two weeks I release 2.1 with bugfixes and probably some cheap
new thing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		~~DONE AND TODO LIST~~
DONE (since last beta):
·150 pokemon inserted, all of them but legendaries with a lot of data done. Don't gameshark mewtwo or you'll know the truth.
·Storyline from the EGG TRAIN to VICE VALLEY, including cool things like shiny pokemon, dancing scripts and the train.
·Map scripts.
·Explosion now substitutes Dive. Rock smash will be substituted by spider web in the future.
·That's a lot already, even in 3 lines
·Got the idea and the method to switch cries, although they're not done yet

TODO:
·pokemon stats, as well as breeding data and stuff on the likes
·pokemon trade scripts. I found how they work, need to set them up. THEY'RE ENABLED, BUT UNEDITED, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED
·Redo Ninjice statues tutors. I'll try to standard and change them.
·"previously on your quest" stuff. Seriously, that shit is gay.
·pokedex rating. If you check it, you'll get it rated by oak.
·world map. I won't do it until at least all the garna region is completed. And then there will be the other three regions.
·The rest of the story, maps, and all the stuff.
·Make my own music. That'll be in summer, considering I can make it to put them in. If so, it's gonna be cool.
·Teachy TV. In the portable DVD, it'll be good old J.Akira teaching you how to be the very best.
·pokemon icons (nothing until I'll make all the pokemon)
·Make three more pokemon and move zochoga, jikokuki and komokume to the national pokedex where they belong

#############################################################################################################################
This hack is based on Nintendo Game Freak's Pokémon Fire Red (US). Free distribution only in ips patch. Selling the game or
distribution in rom form is illegal.

Ips patch should be used on a clean Fire Red (US) for good use. If you get glitches or other stuff, you're doing it wrong.

All the custom sprites, texts, character desing and creatures that are different than the original Fire Red's are made by
BARO, and you don't have my permission to use them (you can ask for it though, but don't expect anything).

All characters but Baro were made up and have no base in real characters. Any similarity between J.Akira and Bono is pure
coincidence.
