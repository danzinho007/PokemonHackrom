BUGFIXES FROM BETA 2 TO BETA 2.1

 Corrected minor mistakes such as trainers with wrong pics and movement permission mistakes
 Downed wild frequency in Wistwoods and wist castle for anti-annoy effects
 Hacked the back door of vanilla museum
 Magiken no longer has shadow tag, so you can't get stuck if you find a magiken GHOST at wist castle.
 Hacked four pokemon trades
 Finally adjusted door management in the script where you meet Baro and he takes you to the lab.
 Edited belly dance script; now you have to repeat the full puzzle if you fail, but the dancer does the steps slower. Also, waist move is shorter. All of this is done to eliminate bugs
 Corrected some pokemon gender data: frigopter and clabell are now always female.
 Set a new overworld sprite for swimmers, whose sprite was used for female touaregs
