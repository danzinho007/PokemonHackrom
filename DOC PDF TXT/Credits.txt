The girl I love, a lot of TV directives, Ex-president Aznar -not Ansar- plus his frend -not friend- Georgy
W(C) BUSH, Georgy Damn, the fatty who playbacked Dragostea, the creator of the Badger's song and Cálico Electrónico,
who made BARO go crazy enough in so many different ways that I could create my multiple personalities and work
so hard on this.
