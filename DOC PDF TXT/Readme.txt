Pokémon DarkViolet
by Chaos Rush

Pokémon DarkViolet is a hack of Pokémon FireRed Version for the Game Boy
Advance. Pokémon DarkViolet functions as a remake of Pokémon Red & Green
Versions for the Game Boy, albeit with a twist. The original idea for this
hack was to "modernize" Kanto. Also, the story was heavily modified to be
modeled after Pokémon Black & White, which was the newest Pokémon games when
Pokémon DarkViolet began development. (WARNING: This hack's story is really
immature and "edgy", and some may argue that it ruins the game altogether)

Pokémon DarkViolet is a hack that was originally developed by me (Chaos Rush)
during 2012-2014. In early 2014, I decided to cancel the hack after completing
about 75-80% of the hack. In early 2018, hacksrepairman decided to finish the
rest of the hack, then I added some "finishing touches" to the last portion of
the hack that was done by hacksrepairman. Although this hack is finished and
fully playable, it does not represent exactly what my vision for this back in
2014, although it is pretty close. Specifically, the hack was originally
canceled after development reached the 7th Gym. Thus, all content after that
point should be viewed as a "close idea" of what the hack would have been like
had it been finished in 2014.

Please be aware that this hack was primarily developed during 2012-2014. Thus,
it does not contain many of the additions that have become staples in Pokémon
ROM hacks since that time, such as Fairy-type and Mega Evolution. There are no
plans to add those features to this hack.

Please apply the IPS patch file to a clean Pokémon FireRed(US) ROM.
