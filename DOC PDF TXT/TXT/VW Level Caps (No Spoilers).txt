These are the level caps of all important fights/routes without spoiling anything. This is meant for those
who are playing blind as the level curve can be extreme at times and also I know that people like to use
level caps while still playing blind. This list gives you the highest level pokemon in any given fight or on
any given route in the order in which you can access them. For example, the highest level for Route 3 is 18
before Wellspring Cave, but it is 23 after. Good luck.
