▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ HOW TO PLAY - ANDROID ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

1) Download the 1636 - Pokemon Fire Red (U)(Squirrels) rom. I can't give you any link, so don't ask for it.
2.A) Download Lemuroid or RetroArch from the PlayStore. If you downloaded RetroArch, use the mGBA core.
2.B) Download Retroarch from the Altstore and use the mGBA core.
3) Unzip the game archive and open the game folder.
4) Go to https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/ or use another rom patcher.
Rom File -> Browse -> Pokemon Fire Red (U)(Squirrels).gba
Patch File -> Browse -> "your patch".ups
5) After all of this, click on Apply Patch
6) Open your patched rom with Lemuroid (Android) or RetroArch (Android/iOS). Have fun

If the patch doesn't match the rom, it means you downloaded the wrong base rom.
If you are playing on retroarch core of mGBA, be sure to go to Core Options and disable "Use BIOS File if found".
