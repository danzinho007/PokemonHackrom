▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ HOW TO PLAY - PC ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

1) Download the 1636 - Pokemon Fire Red (U)(Squirrels) rom. I can't give you any link, so don't ask for it.
2) Download mGBA 0.9.2, mGBA 0.10 or mGBA 0.10.2 from the mGBA website: https://mgba.io/
3) Unzip the game archive and open the game folder.
4) Open NUPS (or a random .ups rom patcher).
File to patch -> Browse -> Pokemon Fire Red (U)(Squirrels).gba
UPS Patch -> Browse -> "your patch".ups
If file is invalid -> Abort
5) After all of this, click on patch.
6) Open your patched rom with mGBA. Have fun.

If the patch doesn't match the rom, it means you downloaded the wrong base rom.
If you are playing on retroarch core of mGBA, be sure to go to Core Options and disable "Use BIOS File if found".
