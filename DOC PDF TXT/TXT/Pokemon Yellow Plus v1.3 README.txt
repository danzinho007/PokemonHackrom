Pokemon Yellow Plus is something I threw together so I could try to complete the Pokedex like I never got to as a kid. I had tried to find one already made but all the ones I found added too much new content for my taste, I just wanted a simple 151 hack for Yellow and here it is :)

FEATURES:

Crit rate fixed (1/16 chance and Focus Energy/Dire Hits work properly)
Type effectiveness updated (ghost is now super effective against psychic, poison normally effective against bug, ice not very effective against fire, bug not very effective against poison and ghost)

There are two patches, one that changes the TM Brock gives you into SURF so you can teach it to Pikachu, and the other does not.

Changed Impossible Evo's:
Kadabra evolves into Alakazam at Level 37
Graveler evolves into Golem at Level 37
Machoke evolves into Machamp at Level 37
Haunter evolves into Gengar at Level 37
