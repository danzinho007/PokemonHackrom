Pokemon Ultra Quartz - Lets Go! Blobbos

Originally created for the Le Ruse Bird drunken funtime twitch stream, this is a big improvement hack of the 2006 romhacking classic by BARO BOAR himself: Pokemon Quartz

In addition to the original game's classic spanglish glory, there are a number of major changes including:

>Completely unique new stats and movesets for all 386 of Baro's fakemon (in the original they just had the stats of whatever they had replaced in the dex)
>National Dex available from the start with nearly all of the Pokemon made available
>Every single trainer in the game edited, higher level curve and other enhancements
>Overworld tiles from Pokemon Emerald instead of RS
>Re-enabled Game Corner
>Re-enabled Battle Tower, take the ultimate challenge in Corna!
>several new quests including guest appearances by a certain group of blue afroed men from another famous romhack by The Cutlerine

and most importantly, a very special friend from Pokemon Clover: Blobbos!

--------------------------------------------------

included in the download are two separate patches:
>one to patch onto base Pokemon Ruby 1.0
>one to patch on top of the original Pokemon Quartz romhack
either will produce the same resulting ROM

Known bugs:
>some tile errors around the battle tower I don't know how to fix and most likely won't bother with

Changelog:
1.1 - fixed a crashing bug in white jungle
1.2 - several miscelaneous bugfixes
1.3 - fixed bugged movesets and added a few more legendary events
1.4 - new legendary event, fixed a bugged trainer, new postgame rematch, fixed a few TM learnsets
2.0 - added final area, bugfixes
