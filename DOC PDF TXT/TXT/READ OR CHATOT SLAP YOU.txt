this fanhack adds a fun quality of life feature such as being able to use your starter unevolved (level them holding a potion at any evolution stage they'll turn into their X variants, which are basically the first stages of them but much more powerful. You can switch back between the X forms and the fully evolved by having them level up holding a super potion and then potion again to change back to their X form) 


You can also buy a bunch of rare candies from a few marts (Rustbaro, Foretree, Ever Grande) to avoid having to grind, i wouldn't recommend going over the gym leaders pokemon however because overleveling ruins the fun, so i recommend staying a little bit under or matching the gym leaders for maximum fun
