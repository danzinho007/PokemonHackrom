Basic Instructions:

2) Set RTC and Save Type to Flash 128K on your emulator (all the test are done on mGBA)
3) Support original mod Emerald Final by dearman4

* About the Mod *
-----------------

The first attempt of this mod was expanded modification from Emerald Final Deluxe (Version 7.41) from dearman4.

But due some problems adding the new maps without breaking the music and music data, I did a fresh start from a clean Rom with the decaptalization patch
made by Verloren5. Maybe I try again modding Emerald Final(when the new update comes)

It's a simple mod to achieve something I always wanted in a gen3 Pokemon rom hack.

The major change in this mod is the addition of Kanto, Johto and Sevii Island Regions as explorable areas (The new maps use the Tileset already in Emerald).

The Wild encounters in Hoenn changed to acommodate better the split to other Regions inclusion.

The Pokenav Trainers in Match Calls are modified to be notable characters, gym leaders, protagonists, elite four members, champions and villains.

The new regions are acessible from:

1) Kanto - Boat in Oldale Port to Pallet Town - Acessible after getting the Pokénav
2) Johto - Boat in Petalburg Port to New Bark Town - Acessible after getting the Pokénav
3) Sevii - Boats in Cianwood Port

Obs:

-Kanto and Johto are kind of Semi-Open World (Added sidequests to Tea; Silph Scope; Pokeflute in Kanto)
-You need Surf to access Sevii Islands
-Fly is only usable in Hoenn Region.
-There's a fast travel between Saffron City (Kanto) and Goldenrod City (Johto) (Added Power Plant side quest to activate)
-There's a fast travel between Vermilion City (Kanto) and Olivine City (Johto)
-The game is still incomplete and WIP.


NOTICE: This mod is still unfinished. This build is for beta testing. Mostly to verify if all the changes I did broke something.
