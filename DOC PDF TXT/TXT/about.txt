Pokemon HeartGold VX: Vanilla Expanded is a romhack of Pokemon HeartGold Version for the Nintendo DS.
It is made for Pokemon HeartGold fans who want more out of the game but don't want to play a hack that transforms it into a completely different game.

HeartGold VX expands the playable roster by making many postgame-only Pokemon catchable during the main game. Pokemon exclusive to SoulSilver version are included as well.
NPC opponents also use new Pokemon, so the player is not the only trainer with expanded options.

Pokemon with trade or Sinnoh-only evolutions can be evolved by alternate means in HeartGold VX.

There are many other small changes as well, which you can read about in the database provided.
