Hello, this is a little guide for the event Pokémon that you received as a 1kb patch.

How to use it:

1. Patch it to Pokémon Saiph's rom.
(Not a clean FR rom but an already patched rom)

2. If the patcher program gives you an error choose an ignoring option.
(I would recommend patching with NUPS with the 'ignore' option chosen)

3. Once its patched, you will be able to obtain the special Pokémon
in Chargy City's Pokémon Center from a delivery man standing at the counter.
(Just like in most official Pokémon games)

You are pretty much done, keep in mind this patch can be used as many times as you
want, however the event gift is only obtainable once per rom!
(Its also only compatible with Pokémon Saiph's Final release)
