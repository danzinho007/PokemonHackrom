;;;;;;Q&A;;;;;;;

-Where's Victini? Why didn't you add it in a wild area just like the others?

Mostly because he's already catchable in an event-only area that can be accesed by inserting Liberty Ticket's Wondercard manually via PkHex.
For more info in the matter please check the following link: https://projectpokemon.org/tutorials/save-editing/using-pkhex/importing-wondercards-r29/

-I didn't like how yoy did "X"/ I found an oversight/ there's something it could have been done better.

Feel free to send me a PM. This is my first pokemon romhack I've publicly released, so any sort of feedback and criticism is highly appreciated.
