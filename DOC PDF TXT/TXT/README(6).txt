--< 1. Getting Started >--
 
1.1) Emulator:
   Only VBA (VisuaBoy Advance) and VBA-M are officially supported for PC. Other emulators may cause some errors.
   MyBoy! and John GBA for Android mobile appear to be stable.
   There are no known compatible iOS GBA emulators at the moment.
   Playing on any other platforms will cause crashes at either the Oak intro or anything Mega Evolution related.
 
   SET THE SAVE TYPE ON THE EMULATOR BEFORE PLAYING
   For VBA:
   Go under Option > Emulator > Save Type
   1) Check Automatic
   2) Check Flash 128K
   UNABLE TO SAVE YOUR GAME? Here's how you fix it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIhAVH1yMG0
 
1.2) ROM and Patching Info:
   The UPS file must be patched to this specific FireRed GBA ROM:
   1636 - Pokemon Fire Red (U)(Squirrels).gba
 
   WE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT PROVIDE ROMS
 
   If the ROM you have on hand does not have the above filename, we strongly advise against patching to it.
   You can verify if you have the correct ROM. The CRC32 hex code for the correct ROM is DD88761C. The MD5 is e26ee0d44e809351c8ce2d73c7400cdd.
 
   Use a .ups patcher (such as NUPS or tsukuyomi) to apply the .ups patch to the .gba ROM.
   We recommend keeping a fresh copy of the original ROM for when a new update is released.
 
   DO NOT RANDOMIZE THIS GAME
 
--< 2. About the Patch >--
 
2.1) Features
   All featured Pokémon have been replaced with their Moémon counterparts!
   Over 570 species are available, with more than 630 designs in the game!
 
   In addition to most of the Gen 1-3 Moémon, several future generation Moémon are also available to catch.
   Several future generation moves are also in the game. Including the physical/special split from Gen 4.
 
   The Mega Evolution from XY and ORAS has been implemented.
      How to Mega Evolve:
      1: Have a Mega Bracelet in your inventory
      2. Give the Moémon the correct Mega Stone to hold
      3. In battle, select Attack, then press Start (whatever your key is)
      4. Use a move.
 
      Blaziken, Sceptile, Swampert, Latias, Latios, Banette, Aerodactyl, Mawile, Altaria, Lopunny, Gardevoir, Camerupt, Glalie, Lucario, Pidgeot, Gyarados, Sharpedo, Ampharos, Slowbro, Houndoom, Manectric, Tyranitar, Beedrill, Aggron, Kangaskhan, Scizor and the Kanto starters can Mega Evolve.
      Mega Stones can be bought in Cerulean City after obtaining the Mega Bracelet from Mr. Fuji.
 
   Many post-Gen 3 and trade evolutions in FireRed have been changed to other evolution methods.
   Evolution items can be found in Celadon City.
   Please experiment among Stones, level-up, and friendship for evolving Moémon.
   No evolution is gender-locked or requires held items as of now. This will change in 2.0.
 
   Almost every Trainer has been updated to use different teams and moves from the base game.
 
   Movesets and Learnsets for every mon has been fixed/updated. Movesets are mostly based on Pokémon X and Y.
   Most evolved mons can learn Egg Moves or TM moves in future generations through the Move Relearner in Two Island.
 
   Move Relearner in Two Island no longer needs mushrooms to teach moves.
 
   Move tutors are now reuseable. Many move tutors teach different moves than in the original game.
   TMs are also reuseable.
 
2.2) Version changes
   1) The Old Rod has been re-added and moved to Cerulean City.
   2) Some maps have been edited slightly.
   3) bug fixes since 1.1.11b: National Dex Crash, Other crashes, Shedinja evolution, display errors, TM disappearance bug, Back Sprite positional errors, and 0 weight Moémon.
   4) 1.1.11e Shiny rates set to match later generations.
   5) A softlock glitch in Clear Forest has been removed.
 -1.2 changes-
   1) Added new landmarks to the Town Map.
   2) Added new evolutionary items.
   3) Added sprites for all the Unown.
   4) Fixed minor bugs related to some species.
   5) Added new events, including Birth Island and Navel Rock events.
 -1.3 changes-
   1) Nerfed the levels in Route 1.
   2) Added previously-unobtainable first-stage Moémon to the wild.
   3) Moved a girl next to Bill's House to make Lover's Cay's location more obvious to the player.
   4) Fixed some evolution methods.
   5) Fixed some broken cries.
   6) Added 10 new Megas.
   7) Changed many Trainer teams to showcase many of the 30+ species additions in this update, plus some other species from 1.2.
   8) Fixed breeding in the Four Island daycare, however every species in the game is obtainable without breeding.
   9) Restored a script from old versions in the Pewter Poké Center to obtain the National Dex in case you're upgrading from a version where it wasn't given at the start.
   10) Fixed some dialogue issues.
   11) Removed all grass next to water so the fishing Double Battle crash no longer happens.
 
--< 3. Bugs >--
 
   1) Certain Abilities that boost stats will freeze the game if they are allowed to boost past 6 boosts.
      - Lightning Rod in particular has been seen healing instead of boosting Special Attack when two mons have the ability
   2) Mega Evolution will corrupt the game in double battles if used. They don't work for link battles either. Doing so may corrupt the data of Moémon in the PC, either by turning them into a BAD EGG or something else.
   3) False Swipe and Brick Break do not work as intended, therefore they have been removed.
   4) Minor Pokédex glitches for post-Hoenn Moémon captures and other text errors. You will usually see Rattata as the "registered" Moémon due to Gen 4+ Moémon not having registered Pokédex Habitats. Their Dex entries can still be viewed normally afterwards.
   5) Wild double battles host a wide variety of glitches
          -The capture text in a wild double battle will always show the name of the first Moémon encountered.
          -If any item was used in a double battle but the battle ends before the item could be used, that item is still consumed
          -Any wild mon using Teleport will end the battle regardless of whether the other one is still there
          -Abilities and moves that trap mons will only work the affected mon, the other mon can still run from battle
          -Certain animations are glitched. This is purely visual.
   6) Using Fly in certain places will show the wrong map, the wrong current position, or both.
   7) The ruins at Seven Island have broken encounters, you will either encounter Unown if your last battle was a normal wild battle, the last Trainer fought if your last battle was a Trainer or a game crash if your last battle was a Double Battle.
   8) Various graphical, textual, and audio errors (icons have garbled palettes in the move screen, Red's Bicycle sprite having a black box on it, some broken Moémon cries in Gen V).
   9) Opponents will sometimes send out a Moémon that is already Mega Evolved. This a limitation of the current engine.
   10) The Ability Download, in addition to its normal function, also makes the mon immune to major status effects. Moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave will play their normal animation but will not apply status. Yawn still works.
   11) Eggs as a second Moémon will trigger wild Double Battles, and may make the game crash if you have only one Moémon and an Egg.
   12) If you enter Tanoby Chambers after a double battle, it could cause the game to crash.
   13) Due to changes made into the game's data, there might be issues with the PokéDex progress from previous versions. Meaning that mons you caught might not appear registered as caught in your PokéDex. Catching the mons again is the only way to recover them. New save files do not share this issue.
   14) Breeding certain species that can Mega Evolve will sometimes result in the offspring coming out Mega Evolved. Doing anything to them will revert their state, so they cannot be sent out into battle.
   15) The Pokédex does not recognize the new maps, so if a species can only be caught in any of those the Dex will say "AREA UNKNOWN". If a first stage species has "AREA UNKNOWN" as the location after the Town Map has been fully upgraded, it's in one of the new areas.
   16) A few gender ratios are incorrect (such as Goomy being genderless).
   17) The moves Dragon Tail and Circle Throw can crash the game, so known instances of those moves have been removed.
 
 
--< 4. Other Information >--
 
   We do not provide support for cheats or randomization. We heavily advise against using them as the results are unpredictable.
 
   Version Notes: 1.X is planned to be the last version where .sav files are compatible from 1.0 and beta versions.
   To use a save from a previous version, make sure the name of the .sav file and the .gba file match.
   The planned 2.0+ versions require new saves, but will have new features, maps and mechanics.
 
   Haven't seen your favorite mon? Chances are we do not have a sprite ready for it.
